## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

My lover is gay and I want him to sleep with other men.

Or is he bisexual?

My lover is straight and I want him to sleep with women.

Or is he tomboy?

My lover is tomboy and I want him to sleep with girls.

Or is he a lesbian?

My lover is tomboy and I want him to sleep with boys.

Ive narrowed it down to three broad broad groups:
Biphobia.
Lesbianism.
Androgyny.

As I go through these please think of the people you didn't even know were queers.

My queer friend may be bisexual.

My queer friend may be tomboy.

My queer friend may be tomboy.

I don't know about you, but I would love to have known!

Now you've narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from there.

Biphobia. Biphobia is when a person's attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on stereotypes, stereotypes that are not based on reality. For example, some people think that if they are gay they cant get laid because they're too feminine. This is called the Biphobia effect.

Now Ive narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from from there.

Orphobia. Orphobia is when a person's attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on the idea of the sacred or sacred gender. For example, some people think that if they are priests they cant get laid because they're too masculine. This is called the Orphobia effect.

Now Ive narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from from there.

Orphobia and Androphobia. Orphobia and Androphobia are usually in conflict. For example, some people may have very strong or very weak attraction to both men and women. Orphobia can also lead to the idea that a person may or may not be gay.

Now Ive narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from from there. Biphobia. Biphobia.

My lover may be bisexual.

My lover may be tomboy.
