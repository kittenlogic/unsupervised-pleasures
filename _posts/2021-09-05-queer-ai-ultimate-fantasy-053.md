## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

A friend of Harvey's has this cabin on a steep hill overlooking the Willamette River. The fire is still burning and the smell is unbearable. He tells me he has a "dream" this weekend in which he thinks he is in "The Pit." I ask him what it is he imagines himself doing there. He tells me he envisions himself leading a normal, middle-class existence. Then, he tells me, suddenly he senses something terrifying and insists I get out of bed.

He says he has been taking hallucinogenic drugs lately, such as Valium and Valium + Lysergic acid diethylamide. He says he dreams of swimming through rapids, of tigers and lions, of armies marching on fields.

"Lunatic fringe" orchard. A quiet place for the weekend. June.
