Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Everybody in the theater says it has the perfect plot. But I can tell you from my own experience that there are many, MANY more!

Meaningless platitudes and preachers on TV bring no joy to anyone, let alone the people you love. We need to find something real in the ordinary, the commonplace, the commonplace that's exceptional. We have to let go of what we don't understand, or don't want to understand.

Idyllic music, breath taking lighting, and fountains of colored lights will bring everyone to a stand still and soak up the ambiance. Then everyone will dance and shout and hug and pray and cry.

I'll be quiet. I'm sure I'm interrupting just before my very eyes the moment a perfectly ordinary high school senior kisses a beautiful redhead.

If Heaven were a movie, Id love to see how they handled the love triangle. Would they twist the knife and sacrifice Tom Cruise so they wouldn't have to cast their hearts into that proverbial garden?

Your turn.

The theory goes something like this. On one end we have the good Christian boy whose heart is always in the right place. On the other we have the Beast, filthy little queer wanted by every grade school principal with a hankie for big hair.

Icks! Shell shock! It's all too much to hope for in the face of temptation. So what do we do? Build a wall, knock the shit out of each other, raise hell, take out shotguns, gut cows, and start killing the shit inside each other.

Jesus!

I don't know. I guess I just have to get used to the feeling that most of what I believe in is bullshit.

Bullshit? I have no need for it! Keep out of it!

What are you trying to convert me, Tom? Do you ever think maybe I could be...?

Idolatry?

Bullshit!

Jesus, you lost me.

Serve, my dear, in large part on your ability to let go of the things you don't understand.

What a wonderful feature of the English language... they can say just about anything and it's perfectly acceptable. I'm still not used to the idea that I owe my life to anybody but myself!

Greek tragedy, tragedy, fuckin' tragedy. Ho hum.

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
