Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. A friend of Harvey's has this cabin on a steep hill overlooking the Willamette River. The fire is still burning and the smell is unbearable. He tells me he has a "dream" this weekend in which he thinks he is in "The Pit." I ask him what it is he imagines himself doing there. He tells me he envisions himself leading a normal, middle-class existence. Suddenly he senses something terrifying and insists I get out of bed. He says he has been taking hallucinogenic drugs lately, such as Valium and Lysergic acid diethylamide. He says he dreams of swimming through rapids, of tigers and lions, of armies marching on fields. Lunatic fringe orchard. A quiet place for the weekend. June.

## Seed

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?
