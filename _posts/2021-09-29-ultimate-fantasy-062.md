Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Gay cruising.

What's that? Oh, cruising! Queer cruising. I adore it!

Can you imagine meeting other queer people for the first time, going to a gay bar on Friday night, cruising the gayborhood all night, then cruising the following Saturday night?

How romantic!<br/>
What would we eat? What would we do?<br/>
How many alcoholic drinks will we consume?<br/>
Will there be blow jobs?<br/>
Can we make love in public places?<br/>
Is there the possibility of bodily harm?<br/>
If we do it in public, will there be angry mob action?<br/>
Queer sex workers.<br/>
Are there bisexual sex workers?<br/>
What about intersex sex workers?<br/>
Are there people with multiple sex partners?

We love to imagine the wild and crazy, the wild and crazy nights! But there has to be a balance. We can't just take the wild and crazy and run with it. There has to be a careful balance.
There has to be an emotional center. Romance has to be based in truth. There has to be. Trust, respect, and affection have to be there.

How about this... Let's say we're a couple and we go out to a bar on a Friday night. Friday is gayborhood time. There's a big line at the front. People are queuing up behind the counter and waiting to get into the gayborhood. Suddenly there's this gorgeous young man, just comes out of the bathroom naked, and he's just staring straight into our eyes. And he's got these big round eyes and he's got this Wow! What an amazing body!

You know what they say, if it has wings, it's a bird. His eyes are blue, like two balloons stuck together. His hands are covered in glitter. His feet are covered in glitter. His arms are covered in glitter. His mouth is covered in glitter. His tongue is glitter. His feet are covered in glitter. His hands are covered in sparkly glitter. His hair is silver. His hair is wild and curly and beautiful and it's blowing in all directions. All night long people are staring and people are taking photos and people are taking videos. Say what you want about this young American gentleman. He just came out of the bathroom naked and he's staring straight into our beautiful eyes.

We could disappear.
You mean disappear?
I could disappear right in front of him.
