## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It may not be what you want either.

I could be a unicorn.<br/>
Or a hoofed gnome.<br/>
Or a vampire.<br/>
Or a unicorn mare.<br/>
Or a home run battering ram.<br/>
Or a water buffalo.<br/>
Or both at once.<br/>
Or none of these at all.

Make it a gay love story. A love story between men.

I could die.<br/>
I could fall in love.<br/>
I could be disowned by my family.<br/>
I could go to jail.<br/>
I could be in love with a woman.<br/>
I could leave my wife and kids for a man.<br/>
Or none of these at all.

There are no wrong answers. In life we make mistakes. We build on them. Love conquers all. Good night.

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
