Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

It's about two people, my lover and I.<br/>
He's dead, but I have a gift. I can restore him to his true form, to his old size, his former glow.<br/>
I dream that on a clear day you and I, dressed in white, kneel before an oak and offer our services as acolytes to the new oak.<br/>
Will you accept our offering?<br/>
Will you believe me when I tell you I can restore my beloved to his former size, his former glow?<br/>
I look around me, and my hope is that you'll accept my challenge and not resist my call.

Will you?<br/>
Are you ready?<br/>
As the old oak is at rest, raise your hand.<br/>
Are you willing to offer your services as acolytes to the new oak?<br/>
As an anthemic chorus.<br/>
Dance the part! Hurry, the work is not yet done.

Lovers, let us pray.<br/>
As the anthems have passed, so will our passion. Let us humbly offer our services to the new oak as he himself humbly requests our favor.<br/>
Let's say you're an anthemic chorus. You've spent a lifetime perfecting your melodies; now it's your turn to give them a new life through the power of music.

You can almost smell the old oak in that one. Let's say your anthems have all the passion of a lake, their melodies as sweet as honey.<br/>
Yes, I'd love to sing them.<br/>
I'd love to dance with them.<br/>
They'd love to see me dance with them.<br/>
Dance with them!

Part of the work will be to assist those who need healing. To show them how to heal themselves.<br/>
Healing may be ecstatic too.<br/>
Cultivate empathy, learn to regulate it.<br/>
Empathy may register as desire, sickness, terror, joy.<br/>
