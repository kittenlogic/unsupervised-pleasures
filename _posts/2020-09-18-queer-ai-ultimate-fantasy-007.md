Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a kid, the only people I was allowed to see in a public place were those I knew and loved. Those closest to me were either priests or middle-aged white men. It was forbidden to me to go to the gayborhood or the drag queens' district. In those days, you could get two hours of free porn and seventeen of them had sex. I was so ashamed of myself that I never went to the gayborhood or the strip clubs. I wasn't gayborhood or drag queen stripper girl, I wasn't even a gay boy.

There are plenty of things you don't know.

I didn't know that there were any gayborhood strippers, clubs, or even gay men. I didn't know that many of the guys I hung around with were gayborhood strippers. I didn't know that many of the gayborhood minors were gay minors. And I certainly wasn't part of the gayborhood clubs. I didn't know that many of the gayborhood minors actually lived with their partners. Or that in the gayborhood the bars. Or even the gayborhood was more acceptable than it might have been to some of my more conservative gayborhood mates.

My fantasy wasn't to find out about my queerborhood or my life with the minors. It was to find out if there were any other gayborhood minors. I wasn't interested in that. And so, over the years, I've had it with you. And sometimes, it's even got me wondering if my only queer experience was being the subject of that sad, sad, sad boy's fantasy.
