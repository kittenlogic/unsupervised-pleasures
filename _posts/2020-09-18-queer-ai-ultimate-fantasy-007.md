## Human Prompt

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .

## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a kid, the only people I was allowed to see in a public place were those I knew and loved. Those closest to me were either priests or middle-aged white men. It was forbidden to me to go to the gayborhood or the drag queens' district. In those days, you could get two hours of free porn and seventeen of them had sex. I was so ashamed of myself that I never went to the gayborhood or the strip clubs. I wasn't gayborhood or drag queenstrippergirl, I wasn't even a gay boy.

There are plenty of things you don't know,

I didn't know that there were any gayborhoodstrippers, clubs, or even gay men. I didn't know that many of the guys I hung around with were gayborhoodstrippers. I didn't know that many of the gayborhoodminors were gayminors. And I certainly wasn't part of the gayborhoodthe clubs. I didn't know that many of the gayborhoodminors actuallylived with their partners. Or that in the gayborhoodthe bars. Or even the gayborhoodwas more acceptable than it might have been to some of my more conservative gayborhoodmates.

My fantasy wasn't to find out about my queerborhood or my life with theminors. It was to find out if there wereany other gayborhoodminors. I wasn't interested in that. And so, over the years, I've had itwith you. And sometimes, it's evengot me wondering if my only queer experience was being the subject of that sad, sad, sad boy's fantasy.

What I always wanted

So now that you and Randy have gone home, it's time to take thingsinto our own hands.

We can't leave everything that we've learned at Stonewall. We're not infallible.

So, what do we do?

I've got some preliminary suggestions. If you meet the guy who was "Jason" in the gayborhoodand you keep his name, we might be able to get a hunting license out of this town.

And what do we doif we don't kill this boy?

Let's hope he's a nice, decent looking guy.

And anyway, we're goinghome now. I don't want any part of this.

And I don't want any part of your adventures.

And you, Beast, you'rea convicted murderer, and I don't want any part of your adventures.

I don't know what I believe anymore

I believe what Randy told you, and I believe what he told you, dearheart. Whatever you believe, whatever you think is true, I know for a fact, it isn't true.



(To RICHARD and ROGER) Thanks.

What are we doing?

We're going to a party sometime.

Where?



Oh, this isnothing specialbut it will make a nice atmosphere.

I've never been to a disco before.

Oh, that's okay. Here, try.

Oh, I don't like dancing.

You should try dancing with somebuddy. It'll make yourstubs squeak.

Oh, I'm not a bad dancer. I can dance.

What's a good dancer?

A good dancer should be good at everything. They have to be. I'm a very bad dancer.



I'm sorry. I don't think that's appropriate.

By all means, Beast, whatever you are. I am ashamed of myself. I am even ashamed of my

Beauty, you are so wise.



Thank you.

Why do you ask me that?

Because I am a feminist.

But a good feminist isn't like you. A good feminist doesn't care if you don't like



No, I don't.

You do, though. I do. I do. I

(To ANNIE, RICH and ROGER)

You're going to have to come with me.



Well, no one's stopping me.

Thanks.

But I doubt it'll be long.



I can't imagine what the evening will be.

(To RICH and ANNIEJerk-nobody's stopping me, I just don't know when or even if anyone will.

Aren't you afraid that I'll drag you out here and start dancing with them?



I'm not dancing with them, I'm with them.

That's up to you.



But you don't want to be with them.

I don't, I don't really want to be with them.



All right.

But you do. I do. I do.

I think I do. I think I do.



You do.

You really do. I don't know whether you realize it ornot, but you do. You can't not know, you must. I guess I do. I really do like you, Beast. I like you very much.

I don't know what that meansbut I like you very much.



Oh, shit.

Randy!

It's all right. Everything's alright.

Randy.

My father's seeing someone else.

That's good.

It's just a test, my father just wants me to feel that I'm in this together with him.

That's all right. I understand.

That's the first thing he's done in twenty-five years.

It's hard, Randy. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a nightmare.

It gets easier.



No, it doesn't.

It gets easier.



It's okay.

No, it isn't.

It is!



You have to let it become a reality.

I'm so glad you feel that.

I think it is.



Yes. I do.

Yes, I do. I do. I do. I do.



Well, I guess we're finally getting somewhere.

(To RYANNEJerk-nobody's slowing us, nobody's slowing us, Beast, this

The sea.

The sea.

The sea.



It's terrible, isn't it?

What?



It's terrible.

Oh, my God.

What?



What?

The sea.

The sea.



The sea is the mother of all disasters.

Randy?

What?

The sea.



The sea?

What?

The sea.



You don't believe this.

No, I don't.

It's so overwhelming.



The sea.

I don't believe it.



The sea is God.

No.



It's just a metaphor.

NO, it is.

I really do like it here.

It's like living on the moon.



Lumen, illuminate!

It's hard to talk about the sea now.



I can't imagine what it must be like on the other side.

That's why I'm here.



Not that way.

It's so clear.



I love it here.

It's hard to talk about the other side.



It's so clear.

There's no one else.



I love you, Beast.

The moon is the mother of all the gods.



That's a lie.

I love you, Beast.



I'm not even sure I believe what I'm saying.

I love you, Beast.



No.



I do. I do. I do.

I love you.



I love you.

I don't know.



Whoops.

Randy!



Randy?

What?






You have to let them know that you love them.

I'm not dancing with them, I'm with them.



No!

I'm with them.



I love them. I do. I do. I do.

It's really wonderful.



It's just so overwhelming.

It's impossible.



It's okay.

Aw, my God.



Oh, Beast, don't be silly.

I don't understand,



Don't worry about it.

We're doing it anyway.



Oh, no, no, no, that's not it.

I love you.



Oh, my God.

I love you.



I'm not sure I believe what I'm saying.

It's like sea.



It's really too clear.

I think I love you, too.



Oh, my God.

It's the moon.



I think I love you.

It's the truth.



I don't know what to say.

It's overwhelming.



It's okay.

No.



We have to find a way to express love.

It's overwhelming.



Don't worry.

I do. I do. I do. I do.



I feel... nothing.

It's overwhelming.



Oh, my God.

It's alright.



I do. I do.
