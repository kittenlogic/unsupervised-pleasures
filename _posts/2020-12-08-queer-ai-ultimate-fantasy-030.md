## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Deep into your soul, you know you want me to take you to a secluded place away from the crowd and show you the beauty and ecstasy of love.

No one has to see that, not your parents, not your co-workers. Or your doctor. Or your priest.

The priest probably doesn't approve.

The alternative. What about deep-rooted? What about love? What about deep-rooted in you?

Your mothers, fathers.

I want you to fuck me. Please.

I can't. NO! No one can! I can't, my mother. NO!

Fuck me, Father.

Fucking me is wrong. It... is wrong. I don't want to, it makes me sick.

I'm horny, make me horny.

Make me sick?

Yes. Fuck me. A good boy.

I'm getting wet. I'm horny, make me horny.

Very good, very good. Slow.

Do I look sexy in your yellow... The sexual revolution has... I... well, if only there was one thing that fucked me up good and sent me straight to Heaven. A moment of silence for what was...

You want to fuck me, you better fuck.

Just one minute, please. Just one minute.

For whatever stupid reason. Guess what? I want to fuck you again.

Please, fuck me. Please.

My clothes are dirty. My friends called the cops. I'm scared.

There's a time and place for everything.

I don't want to hear.

You... dummy, why don't you kiss me? I'll do anything. Go ahead, get in a kiss, anything.

I don't know...

Kiss me. Please.

It's just that right now it's just so hard.

So are you afraid of me or am I just showing you my...

Whatever you want.

Hey, the milk's back. I took the cooler with me. This is crazy, I am a month pregnant. I feel. So fucking. So full.

I'm glad.

Queer bastard.

Go on, babes. Touch us, baby.

Jesus, look at him. Boobs!

They're nice, aren't they?

What?

Babies have no idea what it's like to be a month.

Tush! Tush!

The first trimester. The first days.

I hurt. Nothing. It was a blessing.

Ow, my baby. It's okay. I feel terrific.

And then some more...

Ow, my face.

Not swollen, just a little tender.

A little better?

Tender enough that I can put a cap on it.
