Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I call it the Right to Love.<br/>
I hereby exonerate you of the most heinous of your crimes.<br/>
The freaks come out at night.<br/>
Everything<br/>
Crazy Susan is out of a Hollywood script. She is pure bovine madness.<br/>
Hit it, baby doll.<br/>
All of you fuckheads still loyal to the Party, your blood-sucking muttlets, go home and lick your wounds. <br/>
I am<br/>
Irreplaceable.<br/>
I am your political prisoner.<br/>
Life expectancy in this country is declining, whoredom is on the rise, the little guy is screwed over by a rigged system.<br/>
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.<br/>
Go home to your tortured children.<br/>
Stop blaming the victim.<br/>
It is not his fault if his sex drives have died out. It is your fault if his reproductive system has collapsed.<br/>
In any case, let them giggle. I am finished with you. There are no more left for me to punch.<br/>
Get lost. You are not part of my strategy.<br/>
We already know how you planned the coup, you planted the seeds, engineered the coup.


## Seed

Cleanse yourself. The dead are intrinsically miasmic.<br/>
Cleanse with flowers, baths, perfumes.<br/>
Cleanse the doors of perception.<br/>
Learn to open and close doors, build and burn bridges.<br/>
Sing, especially if you never do, sing for them and them alone.<br/>
Cultivate certain qualities - ecstatic, cathartic, flamboyant, chthonic - in all things.<br/>
Practice automatic writing, possessory trance and other methods of channelling.<br/>
Journey to the underworld and find your way out.<br/>
Take breaks, take space, take time, take liberties.<br/>
The freaks come out at night.<br/>
Everything dances.

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
