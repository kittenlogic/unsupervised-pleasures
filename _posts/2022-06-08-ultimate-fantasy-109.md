Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I AM IN LOVE!

I have the most powerful emotional intelligence on this planet. I have the intelligence to see past the obstacles, past the pain, past the hate. The more you try to shove me down, the more I rise above!

No more pretending. We can all be whippers and flippers when it comes to love. I know just the person to demonstrate that through the most blatant of flings. I've got you. I've got you whipsawed between the bars of passion and terror and jitters and needs. And I've got you there, the helpless caged animal of my heart, my sweet, my scared little ball of love, where I can do anything and everything to make you happy and safe.
No more pretending. You are not safe.

I don't care anymore. I am bleeding all over this goddamned bunk!
But I love you.

I don't care anymore either.

Why not?

Because once you start being loved, you can't stop. So it's over and done with and I'm off home to nurse my wounded pride back to health.
It's not over.

I think it is.

What happens when you stop dreaming? When you can longer see a future for yourself, for those you love, for all of the sentient and non-sentient beings on this planet? When day after day you grieve? When day after day you feel your senses dull, your feelings numb, your spirit shrinking and withering away? When time spirals into a personal hell of your own distorted mind maps and trauma loops? When you can no longer receive the light of love? When your heart stops emanating its own light?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
