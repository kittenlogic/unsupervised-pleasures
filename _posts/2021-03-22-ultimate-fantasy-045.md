Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

If I get to be president of the United States...

Im going to put an X on that card and shove it up your nose. It reads:

"I."

If I get elected...

Im going to have one of your senators tattoo my bicep with the words: "I Love Barrett's Ass."

If I get elected, I am going to eliminate the F.B.I.

My first act will be to sign a bill making it a crime to aid any foreign power in resisting American domination.

Im going to end sex education in our public schools.

My first act will be to eliminate the F.B.I.

My second act will be to eliminate the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.

My second act will be to eliminate the Human Rights Campaign.

My second act will be to eliminate the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.

My second act will be to eliminate the American Humanist Association.

That's right. We have one less voting bloc.

Sumba! We have won!

You are all wrong.

But I digress.

Hello?
