Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It is to have a yacht up above the yacht club, in the Bermuda Triangle, cruising the Great Lakes, New England, up to the Massachusetts Bay, and down to Randolph County, Virginia where, one afternoon, the manager will let all the girls into his yacht club and lead them nude up to the balcony where he will set up his jacuzzi, and from there they can all masturbate together.

I will spend the rest of my life climbing aboard those twenty-foot yacht rowing boats and watching the men fuck. A man could take my picture and I would not object. Picture it. A naked man climbs aboard a yacht up the Great Lakes to watch men fuck.

Sodomy is bad, right?

It's warfare. When the men are drunk and high, when they have no inhibitions, they get wild, they get rough. That's when they fuck. That's what they do. They fuck, baby. It's a game-changer.

But that's not what I believe in. I believe in having a constructive dialogue about sex. Sex is a game. A game. You win when one person or a small group of people acts in a way that is positively constructive and that is good for the overall health and happiness of the whole community.

When the original sin was being gay, I believed that it was cast off long ago. I no longer believe that.



## Seed

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
