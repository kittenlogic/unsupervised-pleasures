## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

The tomb, the tomb all the way up there.

This is where we'll lie together.

Suck each other to death.

Orgasm together.

Dirty love.

Deep throating.

Scary sex.

The feeling is so real...

You never get tired of the sound, the smell.

Orbiting the moons of Jupiter.

The smell of urine in a swimming pool.

Orbiting the soles of feet.

The taste...

Relax, the taste is divine.

The smell of a foot in a pool of urine is divine.


## Seed

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
