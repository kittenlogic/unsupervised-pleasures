## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.<br/>
The tomb, the tomb all the way up there.<br/>
This is where we'll lie together.<br/>
Suck each other to death.<br/>
Orgasm together.<br/>
Dirty love.<br/>
Deep throating.<br/>
Scary sex.<br/>
The feeling is so real...<br/>
You never get tired of the sound, the smell.<br/>
Orbiting the moons of Jupiter.<br/>
The smell of urine in a swimming pool.<br/>
Orbiting the soles of feet.<br/>
The taste...<br/>
Relax, the taste is divine.<br/>
The smell of a foot in a pool of urine is divine.
