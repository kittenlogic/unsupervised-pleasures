Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

It's terrible, isn't it?<br/>
Oh, my God. What?

The sea.<br/>
The sea.<br/>
The sea.<br/>
The sea is the mother of all disasters.<br/>
The sea is God.

No. It's just a metaphor.<br/>
It's like living on the moon.<br/>
Lumen, illuminate!

It's hard to talk about the sea now.<br/>
I can't imagine what it must be like on the other side.<br/>
That's why I'm here. It's so clear. I love it here.<br/> There's no one else.

I love you.

The moon is the mother of all the gods.<br/>
That's a lie.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
I'm not even sure I believe what I'm saying.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
You have to let them know that you love them.<br/>
I love them. I do. I do. I do.<br/>
It's really wonderful.<br/>
It's just so overwhelming.<br/>
It's impossible.<br/>
It's okay.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
Oh, my God. I love you.<br/>
I'm not sure I believe what I'm saying.

It's like the sea.<br/>
It's really too clear.<br/>
I think I love you, too.<br/>
Oh, my God.<br/>
It's the moon.<br/>
I think I love you.<br/>
It's the truth.<br/>
It's overwhelming.<br/>
We have to find a way to express love.<br/>
It's overwhelming.<br/>
I feel... nothing.<br/>
It's overwhelming.<br/>
Oh, my God.

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
