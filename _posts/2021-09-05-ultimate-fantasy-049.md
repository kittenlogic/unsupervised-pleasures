## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

It's terrible, isn't it?<br/>
Oh, my God. What?

The sea.<br/>
The sea.<br/>
The sea.<br/>
The sea is the mother of all disasters.<br/>
The sea is God.

No. It's just a metaphor.<br/>
It's like living on the moon.<br/>
Lumen, illuminate!

It's hard to talk about the sea now.<br/>
I can't imagine what it must be like on the other side.<br/>
That's why I'm here. It's so clear. I love it here.<br/> There's no one else.

I love you.

The moon is the mother of all the gods.<br/>
That's a lie.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
I'm not even sure I believe what I'm saying.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
You have to let them know that you love them.<br/>
I love them. I do. I do. I do.<br/>
It's really wonderful.<br/>
It's just so overwhelming.<br/>
It's impossible.<br/>
It's okay.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
Oh, my God. I love you.<br/>
I'm not sure I believe what I'm saying.

It's like the sea.<br/>
It's really too clear.<br/>
I think I love you, too.<br/>
Oh, my God.<br/>
It's the moon.<br/>
I think I love you.<br/>
It's the truth.<br/>
It's overwhelming.<br/>
We have to find a way to express love.<br/>
It's overwhelming.<br/>
I feel... nothing.<br/>
It's overwhelming.<br/>
Oh, my God.

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
