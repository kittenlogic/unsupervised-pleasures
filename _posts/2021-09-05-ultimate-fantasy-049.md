## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

The sea.<br/>
The sea.<br/>
The sea.

It's terrible, isn't it?

What?

It's terrible.

Oh, my God. What? What?

The sea.<br/>
The sea.<br/>
The sea is the mother of all disasters.

You don't believe this.

No, I don't.

It's so overwhelming.

The sea.<br/>
The sea is God.

No. It's just a metaphor.

NO, it is.

I really do like it here.

It's like living on the moon.

Lumen, illuminate!

It's hard to talk about the sea now.

I can't imagine what it must be like on the other side.

That's why I'm here. It's so clear. I love it here. There's no one else.

I love you.

The moon is the mother of all the gods.

That's a lie.

I love you.

I'm not even sure I believe what I'm saying.

I love you.

You have to let them know that you love them.

I love them. I do. I do. I do.

It's really wonderful.

It's just so overwhelming.

It's impossible.

It's okay.

I love you.

Oh, my God. I love you.

I'm not sure I believe what I'm saying.

It's like sea.

It's really too clear.

I think I love you, too.

Oh, my God.

It's the moon.

I think I love you.

It's the truth.

It's overwhelming.

We have to find a way to express love.

It's overwhelming.

I feel... nothing.

It's overwhelming.

Oh, my God.
