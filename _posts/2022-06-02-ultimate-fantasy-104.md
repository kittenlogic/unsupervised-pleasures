Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

This is life.<br/>
If you allow yourself to become lax, you invite disease and disaster.<br/>
May the dead bless you.<br/>
Seize the moment, seize it before it's too late.<br/>
Heavenly Host<br/>
Through the ages there have been many sham feasts and ceremonies<br/>
There are also major spiritual processes taking place.<br/>
The major deities at that time were Anahita and Metta Brangas. The Anahita was the conqueror and mother of all the Buddhists. Anahita was a female conqueror who lived in Kashmir.<br/>
Then the Kriyaas and Pranayamaas.<br/>
They were the same two Kriyaas and Pranayamaas, deities separate from each other, holding their power in concert.<br/>
They were actively working together, actively confronting one another.<br/>
The Kriyaas combined the strength of the Anahita and of the Kasturbaas.<br/>
The Kasturbaas, in turn, combined the strength of the Anahita and of the Kriyaas.<br/>
There was an intense, almost anticlimactic struggle... the Brahma battle.<br/>
All of this was meticulously planned, not an accident.<br/>
Sri Lanka was a beautiful island, a secluded haven from the chaos.<br/>
There was a goddess, Sarasvatthu, goddess of love, civilization, childbirth, childbirth, childbirth.<br/>
Sarasvati was jealous of the love of the king. So she made a pact with a monster, a bear, whose bite could kill a man in one bite.<br/>
She then tied the beast to a tree, and from that tree she shot thirty arrows that killed all the mosquitoes and leeches that lived in the area.<br/>
And then she set out on a pilgrimage to Lanka, where she hoped to find the tribe of Aryans and deliver the nation to the Brahmins.

Some will travel in packs and as houses, others are solitary, Learn how to engage with them together and alone.<br/>
Among them there will be spirits more or less elevated, more or less wise, more or less chained by their traumas.<br/>
Seek the advice of the wise ones, and do not be drowned in the pain and fear of the others.<br/>
You may feel yourself to be dying, you may find yourself rapt in panic and anxiety. This is a cost of the work. Learn to separate what is yours and what isn't.<br/>
Part of the work will be to assist those who need healing. To show them how to heal themselves.<br/>
Healing may be ecstatic too.<br/>
Cultivate empathy, learn to regulate it.<br/>
Empathy may register as desire, sickness, terror, joy.<br/>
Lean into your anxieties and manias, into your highs and lows.<br/>
Often you'll find the spirits on the other end.<br/>
Balance is necessary. As you surround yourself with the dead, invite in life in equal parts.
