Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I have a fantasy in which I am one of three human beings with the same sex who have just had a marvelous sexual experience. I call it an "Oxytocin Dream."

We are talking about a surge of epinephrine coursing through my body, a kind of high that puts me in a pleasant stupor and puts out a forest of lights.
An epinephrine surge! Then, the most wonderful thing happens. I become a nonhuman being.

Nonhuman being?

A.k.a. feeling okay as long as it's not too hot. Then it's time for bed.

Will you tell me what an epinephrine surge is?

If I do, will you please leave me alone? I never want to have to explain it again.
You want an epinephrine surge? Epinephrine is the brain's "happy glue." Epinephrine floods the brain with epinephrine, creating a kind of a high.

I'm really not feeling so hot.

Then relax.

Why does the brain make such a great supply of epinephrine? Are you tense? Are you in a daze? Have your eyes been puffy or have your irises popped out? Put on your oxygen mask and strap on your epinephrine. You and your lover are going to need it. The brain may even swell to accommodate the surge, creating a kind of a second heart. The second heart will pump the bloodstream with lots of epinephrine, keeping you alert and warm.

Now let's get down to brass tacks. Are your nipples hard?

I'm telling you, they are hard!

You want epinephrias? Epinephrine floods the brain with epinephrine, creating a kind of a hard lump. You want a real epinephrine high? Imagine my joy! Epinephrine floods the brain with epinephrine, creating a kind of a brain fog.

This stuff is killing me.

Then relax.

This is great.

Now let's get down to brass tacks. Is your penis stiff or has it become hard?

It's becoming hard.

Crappy brain cells don't help matters, do they?

Don't worry. I'm here to help.<br/>
... but first, you'll have to relax.<br/>
Are you all right?

Nice bump. That's better.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
