Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, we had a band on tour. One night, they tore a hole in the ceiling of our hotel. We were nearly drowned. We were standing on the edge of the pool when the water began to rise. As we swam to safety, a few of the band members jumped into the pool and began to perform a song.

The water was crystal clear, but the dizzy stage show kept us in the clear. As we neared the hotel, several other hoteliers sprang to attention and began to race down the street toward the pool. I stood watch as the mob swelled to several hundred. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a figure disappear into the pool.

No. You didn't see it. You weren't paying attention. You focused instead on that one individual you were watching swim toward the hotel.

I should have been scared. I should have been panicking. Instead, I carried on enjoying the show. I slept through most of the next day. The next morning, I was walking down the street with my best friends as the moonlight slowly began to fade. As I turned a corner, a hand grabbed mine and pulled me toward the moonlight.

What happens when you stop dreaming? When you can longer see a future for yourself, for those you love, for all of the sentient and non-sentient beings on this planet? When day after day you grieve? When day after day you feel your senses dull, your feelings numb, your spirit shrinking and withering away? When time spirals into a personal hell of your own distorted mind maps and trauma loops? When you can no longer receive the light of love? When your heart stops emanating its own light?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
