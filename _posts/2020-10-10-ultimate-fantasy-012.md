Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college, I came home from a party with a really horny high school senior who kept telling me how he and his friend Jake were planning to have a "Boy Love Night."

As I related this story to my friend, she blurted out, "What's so funny?"

I thought for a moment, then said, "He's straight!" And "How are they going to get it up in here?" And "How are they planning to get it up?" I felt my jaw drop open.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to denigrate any of those relationships. But there are aspects that struck me as particularly perverted.

Guys, I have a confession to make. It's late, I'm exhausted, I've got dinner to go, and I just want to be alone with my most sexual desire.

This is it. We've all got to turn on the lights. Please join me. This is the part of the show where I explain to you why my ex-boyfriend and I have been lovers since the day we first laid eyes on each other.

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .
