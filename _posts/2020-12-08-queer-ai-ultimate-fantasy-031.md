## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It's not for everyone. But for me it's a beginning, not a middle, not a destination. I want you to be my friend for the next thirty years or so, not just because I want to but because you want to. I want to hang on to that friendship as long as I can 'cause it's that friendship that keeps me going. It may not be the friendship that's making all the difference in the world, but that's the friendship I have. And that's what I want.

That's what you have to understand about me. I am monogamous.

I know. So? That's okay? Okay for you. It's not always so easy, particularly for those of us with less traditionally masculine tastes. But don't despair. There are still plenty of you. There are always men. And beautiful men. In men.

So there are lots of lonely queer men.

There are. But they're isolated and frightened, too. Maybe you are. Or maybe you aren't. Let me help you find one.

I... want you to fuck me.

It's a starting place, not an end.

Exactly. Not an end in and of itself. But a starting place.

What if...?

Please? I'm not asking if. I'm just being polite.

I want to. That's all.

Why are you asking? I just don't want to know.

You never do.

I always do. Because I care.

Exactly. And that's not always easy to see or understand. We care about you because

Not always. Ask your mother. Your friends. They'll tell you all about it. Want to bet who cares more? I care about you because

Because I love you.

Exactly.

That's simple. But it gets complicated. Because I can't keep hiding, you see. How many ways are there to love?

I could keep fucking anyone in the world.

Lots. That's why I love you so.

Bastard.

So could I. It's why I want to be your friend forever. To carry on the legacy of that friendship that which began thirty years ago and which you continue to love to this day.

Okay. It's all in there.

How do I take care of you?

Kissing.

That's good. Isn't it? We have a lot in common.

There are certain things that only grownups know.

Guys, kissing is taboo.

Okay. But I promise not to lecture you.
