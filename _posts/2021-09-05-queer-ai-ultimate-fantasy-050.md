## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I was in a garden party and I went down and met an old man who was dying of cancer. He was very kind to me and he was asking me how I was doing.

He said: "Goodbye, darling, you are much prettier now than you were at the party."

I did not know what a garden party was. I thought it was just a party.

Why would he come down and meet you?

Well, he said: "I must tell you that I am very sad, and that is the best way I can express my feelings. I am on my death bed. I don't know if I can live anymore. And, for my part, I must tell you that I am sorry." I said: "Yes, I understand."

What did he say?

"I am very sorry. It seems that I have lost my voice. I am so sorry. I hope I never lose it again."

What did you say?

"Goodbye, darling. It is my last time with you."

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
