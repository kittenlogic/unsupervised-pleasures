Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I imagine we have a certain role-play in store for you.

You come running for the door, all excited about what I've been cooking up.

And all those candles, incense, incense oil, gourds filled with that forbidden intoxicant, you ready to go... when nary a note, not a note, is left on the table!

You want to share a fantasy like I have?

What's it like to be the straight lady who fakes?

Honey, you're really cooking for five. Takes a village to make a meal.

So how does it go down?

O Great. Now let's entertain!

Yeah! Let's make Tidy Up Crispy!!

I could eat this!

Baking soda and water, lots of baking soda. I baked whole... let me show you... hollandaise sauce! Beeswax. And some Worcestershire sauce! And some Old Bay! And Worcestershire cheesecloth! And a little mayonnaise!

I love mayo, it brightens things up.

Now I want your advice on this... mayonnaise!

Well, not the mayo, this is the real mayo... the real mayo, made with real mayo! And it's my new fave!

Homemade! By me, for me!

Buenos noches!

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.
