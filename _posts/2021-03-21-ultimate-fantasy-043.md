Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Be a Saint Theresa of the Immaculate Conception! Libertine Saint Theresa!

You mean you'd rather die than fuck a faggot? Then pick up a book and study the gay life in America. Look at the commercials for birth control, the doctor shopping, and the endless commercials for condoms. And what are we left with? Chopped liver, aching muscles, joint pain, and, God forbid, cancer.

"Cancer is preventable."

"A healthy age for men to have sex is between the ages of 18 and 24."

"Condoms prevent AIDS."

Stop telling me what I can and can't do! I want to be free to love and be myself!

And you'd still rather have a faggot as your lover than a saint like me?

Free will, baby! You're so fucked! What's the matter?

Free will, baby! Just take it away!

Ouch! I nearly died. I thought I'd die the way so many other closeted faggots do. A bullet would have stopped me. But I had Saint Theresa and the bullet didn't.

Free will. Now stop giving me a faggot's pittance.

You want more? I love a real relationship, where you can be yourself and I can be you. No more gay porno!

I hate all that gay crap!

Porn is bad for your health.

Ive been tested negative for Viagra, and they give you a hard time getting it on.

Have you?

You never told me about your erectile dysfunction shots!

And I've never even told you about my life with a man!

You want a faggot's pittance, just like I want a faggot's life!

Ive had enough of this discussion. Get out of my room. You want Saint Theresa?

Free will, baby! I want to die!

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?
