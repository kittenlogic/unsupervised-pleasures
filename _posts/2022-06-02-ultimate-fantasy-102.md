Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.<br/>
You will be transported to a time in your life, when you were most happy.<br/>
The garden at your feet.<br/>
The glories of your youth.<br/>
The sounds on the highway.<br/>
The sighs on the highway.<br/>
Silence.<br/>
The dawn of freedom.<br/>
You will be holding a baby in your arms.<br/>
It is premature to talk politics.<br/>
I have chosen a quiet place.<br/>
I have chosen you.<br/>
My duty is not so much to seduce you as to capture you.<br/>
My duty is to capture you and bring you to me.<br/>
But first you must be freed.<br/>
Will you be my slave?<br/>
I have no intention of slavery.<br/>
But I will require that you be my friend.<br/>
You are my enemy.<br/>
I do not consider you an enemy.<br/>
I consider you my friend.<br/>
Then I will do what is best for both of us.<br/>
I can live with as much as you want.<br/>
With as little as you want.<br/>
Then we will live happily ever after.<br/>
No. No. Never. Never.<br/>
I should like to give you a hand.<br/>
I need a hand.<br/>
I am helpless.<br/>
I am strong.<br/>
You are my undoing.<br/>
Let go of me.<br/>
You are mine!<br/>
I am vulnerable.<br/>
I am beautiful.<br/>
I want more.<br/>
I smell a rose.<br/>
I smell a tree.<br/>
I smell a river.


## Seed

Celebrate birthdays, deathdays, celebrate accomplishments, celebrate festivals.<br/>
Sketch a map of sacred places, an enchanted geography.<br/>
Walk the old haunts; bars and parks and cruising spots. Therein pick up their trace.<br/>
Some will travel in packs and as houses, others are solitary, Learn how to engage with them together and alone.<br/>
Among them there will be spirits more or less elevated, more or less wise, more or less chained by their traumas.<br/>
Seek the advice of the wise ones, and do not be drowned in the pain and fear of the others.<br/>
You may feel yourself to be dying, you may find yourself rapt in panic and anxiety. This is a cost of the work. Learn to separate what is yours and what isn't.<br/>
Part of the work will be to assist those who need healing. To show them how to heal themselves.<br/>
Healing may be ecstatic too.<br/>
Cultivate empathy, learn to regulate it.<br/>
Empathy may register as desire, sickness, terror, joy.<br/>
Lean into your anxieties and manias, into your highs and lows.<br/>
Often you'll find the spirits on the other end.<br/>
Balance is necessary. As you surround yourself with the dead, invite in life in equal parts.
