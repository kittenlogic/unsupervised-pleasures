Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy

I want you to join me...

What?

My fantasy is to pick up, unpack, take everything inside me and go on a wild goose chase across America. I want to leave my clothes in the hamper, my favorite socks in the sock drawer, and my favorite shampoo bottles under the bed. What will we find?

Rich?

Theres nothing between my legs but your clothes.

You've seen enough of me to know that my sensual side lags behind my sexual one.

I find that the more I explore my own sexuality the more aroused I become. This is called deviation.

I wouldn't want you to do this to me.

Why not?

Our sexual fantasies are very limited, and it is the ultimate taboo to talk about them. Even if you've shared them with someone before, you are usually reluctant to discuss them or even get involved in the act itself.

Do I have to do all of this for you?

Don't you love that I care?

Or maybe you don't mind me showing you my clothes?

Alright... it comes out.

My God! Were doing it again! This is so naughty! You take this thing in your hands and work it into my pussy. Oh God yes.. do it with both hands... hard... good! Keep going... oh yes.. feel it inside you.. inside my bellybutton.. inside my thighs.. inside my tight little jeans.. good... keep going... feeling it inside me, filling me up... oh God I want it so bad.. I want it so bad inside me..

Its gone.

Im giving you a blow job.

Do you want to watch me do it?

Don't you dare!

He's going to put a condom on my penis, just like last time.

Isn't that hot?

I'm going to turn on the shower, I'm going to take all my clothes off, I'm going to dry myself off in the hot water, I'm going to stand in front of you, I'm going to take your clothes off and I'm going to turn on the shower... Owwww thats so hot! Don't you want to touch me?

You want to touch me, but don't you want to finger me?

Good boy.

There we are.

There weren't enough surprises this time.

I almost felt like Elise in Bluebeard.

I thought Elise in Bluebeard was more dangerous.

And I was wrong.

When you get right down to it, Elise is the spiritual mother of kinky sex.

Like a claw in my stomach, like the taste of my own blood.

I love when you stroke my hair.

I love the way your hands feel on my hips and the way you nuzzle my stomach.

I love feeling your mouth on my earlobe and caress my cheek.

I love the way you kiss me and nose me on the forehead.

I love the way you nuzzle my forehead between kisses.

I love the way the corner of my mouth brushes the back of your earlobe.

I love the way you kiss me and nuzzle my forehead against mine.

I love the way my hand traces the line of your shoe on the floor.

I love the way the bed feels on my hip and under my armpits.

I love the way you nuzzle my forehead between kisses.

I love the way the head of your penis brushes the back of my earlobe.

I love the way my hand traces the line of your shoe on the floor.

Feels so good.

You taste so good.

You smell so good.

I dream about you.

I'm turning on the light.
