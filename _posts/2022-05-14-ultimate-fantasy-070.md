Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.
I went to a retreat once in Florida, and the retreat house was in a little town just off the highway. It was called Disneyland. They had a really spectacular ride up there, and it was redecorated every night with stained glass windows that showed all the different fairy tales that had been made into the castle. And I got to go up there and look at the stained glass windows. And I was blown away. I mean, I've always been an outdoors person, but I had never seen stained glass windows until I went to Disneyland.

Roy, what would you like to say to someone who has never been to Disneyland?

Guests. Please.

What would you like to say to someone who has been to Disneyland but hasn't been to a wedding?

Guests. Please. I remember five years ago I went to a wedding in Manhattan and there were twenty or thirty thousand people there. There was a reception, and it was just enormous, and there was a throne and a chair and a thousand flowers and everything. And I stood at the far end of the dais and could see this purple cucuirass coming out of that throne, and in that throne were the faces of all the people who had come to say their vows. And I could see, on the far end of that throne, that this purple mantle had these gems.
Surprise, surprise.
And the jewels glittered. Platinum. Diamonds. Amethyst. Topaz.

No. No. No. Let me ask you something.

You said surprise.

Have you ever been to a wedding in Manhattan and seen the same purple casserole that you saw the night of the wedding garnished with fifteen garnets? Have you ever been to a wedding in Manhattan and seen that purple velvet couch, and the purple velvet box that holds it, and the purple paper lantern suspended from the ceiling? Have you ever been to a wedding in Manhattan and seen that? And what do you think is on the far end of that throne? Platinum? Diamonds?

No.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized.1 If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
