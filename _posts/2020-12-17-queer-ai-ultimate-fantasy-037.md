## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. That it may not be what you want either.

I could be a unicorn.

Or a hoofed gnome.

Or a vampire.

Or a unicorn mare.

Or a home run battering ram.

Or a water buffalo.

... Or both at once.

Or none of these at all.

Make it a gay love story. A love story between men.

I could die.

I could fall in love.

I could be disowned by my family.

I could go to jail.

I could be in love with a woman.

I could leave my wife and kids for a man.

Or none of these at all.

There are no wrong answers. In life we make mistakes. We build on them. Love conquers all.

Good night.
