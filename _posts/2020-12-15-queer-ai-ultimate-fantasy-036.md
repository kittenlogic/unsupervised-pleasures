## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

My lover is bisexual and we love each other. He has two wives. One of them he calls mistress and the other he calls girlfriend. They sleep together in their house and he picks up the checkbook at the Post Office. Then he goes to work and leaves the money for the mistress. When he arrives home, he sorts the checkbooks and returns the money to the wives.

I like what you're saying. I think of that wonderful American tradition of giving and giving and giving. We give without expecting anything in return.

You've never been intimate with anyone before, have you?

No.

Then what do you know about safe sex?

I know that intercourse without condoms can cause serious and sometimes fatal diseases. I've heard that going too fast can lead to infection. And that condoms don't provide immediate protection.

But you say you're straight.

I am! And I've been tested for STIs and haven't had an infection.

Do you take precautions? What about personal hygiene?

I'm pretty good at that. I wash my hands after sex and after sex often enough to make sure none stick.

Do you take precautions after sex?

After sex I use a condom, but usually only under very duress and for a very brief time. I don't take precautions at other times.

You need a condom?

Maybe I do.

Why don't you just fuck me?

I'd love to fuck you, but I'm too scared to have sex.

You need a fuck?

Maybe I do. I might be bisexual and that makes me less safe. But I might be scared of what other people think.

You're too scared to be safe. You could infect everyone you love. It's not too late to change your mind.

I am changing my mind. I'm going to have my first ever sexual experience tonight.

That's all that matters.

Please stop fucking around.

Okay! Fine! Great! Now let's get down to business.

Christ, you're such a tease.
