Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My fantasy is that I will be a part of a queer family. My family will be the Zoos, my family will be exotic, mysterious, sexual, smart, beautiful, long lived and, most of all, they will all love me just the same. My family will be simple, straightforward, kind, accepting, giving, brilliant, wise. I will be safe, I will be loved, and my family will be heaven on earth.

Let me tell you what I think will happen. First there will be no horses. Then there will be no visitors. Then there will be no zoos. Then I, you, will have to find our way together in a world of our own. It may seem that way at first, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that it's not at all what I want. I also realize that it is not what many others want. I see my dream as a call to arms. Let us all rally around the Princess. Let us join together to rescue her from the evil clutches of the mansplainer and his syphilitic slave. Let us join together to free ourselves from the yoke of ignorance and bijection and return to the matre d' and laissez faire idealism that made America what it is.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized.1 If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
