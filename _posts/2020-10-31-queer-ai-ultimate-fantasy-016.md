## Human Prompt

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .

## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college I was the most charmed girl on campus. I was so in love with the very idea of collegiate sexual liberation that I vowed never to let it slip again.

College was the Wild West. Lovers threw themselves into the unknown, met their maker on the other side. It was a time of wild sex, sexual discovery, and, above all, the irrepressible desire to share one's passion.

It was during this time period that I first came to know Dan White.

Once upon a time, in the early eighties, a drag queen named Fran Chernow walked into the college gay bar and announced that she was a drag queen because she could.

In those days, collegiate gay life was all-out war. In one fell swoop, the administration had declared that all students, regardless of sexual preference, could be grouped together in a sex-segregated "A" category and be assigned a single, one-night-stand.
I remember standing at that altar that night and contemplating the depravity of my situation. The Lord had no compassion for the sinner! I vowed that I would never again be so easily offended.

As the years wore on, the quality of the sex acts among the "A" category students ranged from filthy to downright filthy. One evening, all the leading lights of the college drag circuit came together to watch Fran's fabulous new show.

There was one problem.

"C'mon, you two. You're not getting any sleep tonight."

"We haven't finished the show."

"But we've read it and we've agreed to it."

You could see how the administration's clever little move might turn out to be their downfall.

While I was in college, a professor of mine came up to me and said to me,
"Mr. Vinge, I believe you know Mr. White. He is a homosexual of some sort. What can I do for you in this situation?"

Believe it or not, I had never heard of Dr. White.
Then, all of a sudden, all of a sudden there was Dr. White in front of me.

At first I was dumbfounded.
He was so down-to-earth and down-to-nothing about his life that I was dumbfounded.

What struck me most about Dr. White was his complete lack of homophobia.
In other words, he was one big, happy, green, high-achieving, heterosexual, gold-digging, Methodist.

The only person involved in this who wasn't wearing a gay wedding band was my roommate, Dr. Kitty Cochrane.

How could you let him get away with that?

Well, the story gets even weirder the roommate got harrumphed up and led out of the house on trumped up charges of battery.

That was just the beginning of it all.

Anyhoo, enough of that. I want to move on and I want justice for all of us. We have all taken sides.

I believe this college has suffered a tremendous loss when a truly distinguished professor is disgraced by his roommate's lesbianism. I've always considered this a witch hunt, brought on by left-wing radicals determined to silence anyone they perceive as expressing conservative views.
