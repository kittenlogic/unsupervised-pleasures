## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It has nothing to do with Blue Cross.

This is for real. I want you to imagine how I would feel if you were a man and I were a woman. Imagine kissing, holding hands, doing intimate body poses. How would we feel? How could we love? How could we live our lives? What would our fantasies be like?

I'd love to have you follow me home from the store and spend the night like we used to. We'd take turns kneeling in the dark, covering each other with our arms.

What if I turned hostile and said, "I don't want to see you anymore" and you had to fight me?

What would our fantasies be like?

I'd love to see you walk down the street alone at night, your breasts swaying as you pass men on the street. I'd love to see the look in your eye as you turned and flashed that "I do"

Let me tell you something, Heather. I have more sex with women than you.

You're lying.

I don't care if you love me or not. I don't care if you want to be my lover. I'd love to see that, and I bet you'd get really turned on watching me do just like that. You'd fall in love with me right then and there, and you could never get me back. You'd be so ashamed and embarrassed!

How do you think it would feel to be mine?

You wouldn't be the first to say that.

Well, you could always start another one.

When you, me, or one of us starts loving someone, that person is usually known by the new name.

So, Sue begins by going by "Sue" and after a few months you'll be known as Tom or Tipper or Tricia.

Does that make any sense?

It was pretty much how I learned about myself.

It's also how most people learn about you.

Me, at least. I didn't grow up with that in mind.

Or you. Did you have to learn it from someone?

No. All I know is that I had it drilled into me that sex with women is very different than sex with men.

How so?

Well, there are subtle differences.

And are there big differences?

I've never seen a man have a clue what a "show-off" a woman is!

You know that Amazonian woman with the long legs and the blue eyes? She's talking to me.

I know that blue-eyed, shamisen goddess with the red hair and the ten fingers!

You're just a typical Amazonian tootling around trying to get your lesbian brethren to like you.

That's not lesbian per se. That's intersex.

So, what are we doing about it?

Me? Nothing. They're going to be stuck with me as long as I live.

Trying to woo a guy in high school?

Sounds silly. But, hey, at least we know how it feels to be the only one who hasn't figured it out yet.

Are we going to start using the words from our first kiss?

I don't know. It might be fun to see how that goes.

Now that's a story!

I feel wonderful!

You do?

You sure do. Is it "oh, my God, I'm so in love!" or is it "OH, MY GOD, I feel so wonderful"!

Naw, babe. You can handle it either way.

I could use a little love myself.

You certainly have your moments.

I get a kick out of seeing you two fight.

I do need a little love myself.

At least in my fantasies.

I'm just not sexually mature enough to want to start out that romantic relationship which could last for years, or even hundreds of years.

You know the statistics on interracial couples.

What?

Married couples have 3.1 children. Divorced or widowed couples have just 1.7

Who's to say how long those unions will last, or how happy those children will be?

Stop talking about numbers.

Couples who have children tend to have happier, more fulfilling, longer-lived relationships.

More?

Be honest with me. How many times have you and I had sex? How many times have you and I cried together?

Too many to choose from.

If that's the kind of relationship you want, fine by all means, have at it. But stop bull-dating me and your readers.

No one is judging.

I would never say that about a book cover.

Publisher's Weekly gives gay people a bad name.

You know the gay press gives a bad name to practically everything they write about.

There are certainly aspects of my life you'd never know about. Though I have tried to be open about my bisexuality.

You wouldn't know about that?

I have.

What you don't know, I do. It goes beyond the obvious. There are darker corners that are too secret for words. As a writer, I want you to know that as well.

I have.

Are you a closeted gay man?

Some of us are.

I've certainly been exposed to that side of the gay experience.

You don't have to be gay to be exposed to that. The gay press does a lot of the heavy lifting in canonizing gay people.

I don't consider myself a canonizer. I consider myself a messenger. If you take my word for it, Michael, there are more great Booker T. Washingtons than closeted gay men.

Michael, I am not a messenger.

You are a messenger and that's an important distinction. I have never met a closeted gay man.

I have. One of the few I knew.

If you're going to spend any time in my life, you're going to have to get to know me.

It will be fascinating to see how he copes.

I'm not worried.

I just don't want you to come to resent me for being there.

So what I'm trying to do is be a friend.

I would have preferred you never met me, but you are the first person I've ever wanted to tell now that I'm married. Which probably means you're the only one. After all, you are the one I married.

Oh, gee, Michael!

I might be a fool but I thought you were straight!

That wasn't my intention at all.

From the start, you were guarded about your sexuality.

"At first I thought I was dying. Then I thought it was cancer. Then I thought it was AIDS. Now I'm straight!"

Don't drag this out.

So, what's the diagnosis?

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the neck, with or without abscess. It usually spreads to the throat and lungs. It usually starts about the age of 45.

How old is he?

50.

Michael, this is Dr. Thomas. He's a cardiologist in Miami.

He's been with Dr. Thomas for almost a year. You two have been seeing each other for over a year.

Well, I feel wonderful. I could not be happier.

And I would like for you to know that we are very much in love.

I know that, Michael.

The things that come to mind when I think of you are of no consequence to me.
As long as you're here.

No. Thank you.
