## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in fifth grade, a boy from the school assembly told me that he had been in love with a girl named Florence. The boy had been in and out of love and lust for many years, but one night, as he was leaving to go away to school, he asked his teacher if she was gay.

The teacher said that she was.

Then he told her that he loved her and that he was in love with her too.

And she ran off to tell her father.

And the father was apoplectic.

But the teacher reassured him that his love for his son was genuine and that he could love anyone he wanted.

That was five and a half years ago.

And now I am in love with you, the bisexual hound, and we have been together for three years, and we are in love.

But I don't want to be intimate with you, the heterosexual hound.

It's okay, it's okay! It's alright.

There are so many ways to love.

Excuse me?

Let me see, how many ways are there to love?

How many ways are there to be gay? How many ways are there to be bisexual? How many ways are there to love?

I see it as a zero-sum game. You get one and you have to get the other. If you get one, you get one less.

Do you have to be gay to love?

You're a zero-sum game.

I could be a zero-sum game.

I could be a lot more than just a zero. I could love more than you.

A lot more. More than you.

You could love someone much more than you.

It doesn't matter. I love you.

But you can't love someone just because they are your lover.

Maybe not just because they are your lover. I love you because you are a good friend and because you want to be good friends with me. I don't care if you're my lover or not. I just want you to be a good friend and to want to be good friends with me.

I could be a lot more than just a good friend.

I could be a lot more than just a friend.

I could be a lot more than just a lover.

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .
