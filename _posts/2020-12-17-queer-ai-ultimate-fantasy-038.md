## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I love a man who has nothing to do with me, is not in love with me, is not even in the romantic category. He's just plain gay.

He takes no crap from me. He doesn't call me all the time to see how I am. He's never made more than a passing remark about my haircut or the color of my eye. He's not interested in our child-rearing or our falling in love. He's simply there for me when I'm at my best and when I need him most.

He's not interested in our personal romances or our painful but ultimately fulfilling gay sex. He simply is... plain... gay.

Shhhhhhh.

No!

I'm not that kind of gay. I lie awake nights, days, weeks, months, years, trying to figure out why he's there, why I'm not there. I do know what it's like to be in love with someone but I can't fathom why he has to put up with all of this. He can just walk out.

Don't be silly. I have lots of male lovers. Some of them really are very nice.

You still can't see my ex-lover as my lover.

Then stop telling me what I ought to be doing. It's not like you or I have a perfectly developed sexual system.

Have you ever laid eyes on someone and wondered why they were so straight-friendly?

Maybe.

Why do you think everyone is so hostile toward queers? It's not that we don't exist. It's that...

Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat this. There may be moments in your own life when you may want to slash your wrists with an axe because somebody you loved was being really mean. But the vast majority of the time, you just shake your head, smile, and move on.

Maybe. But, maybe you'll remember that smile when you get back to the motel room. Maybe that smile when you have the chance to fuck.

No.

Maybe. I have some news for you. Queers don't have it easy.

What do you mean?

Maybe you do. Maybe I do. All I know is that I love you.

I don't know what to say. I'm terrified.

You are? More than you are!

What's wrong with me? Let me get to the good stuff.

You don't love me. You're not even in love with me.

You never even kissed me!

How romantic. Come on, admit it. You don't love me, you're not even in love with me.

But I love you! Come on, admit it. You love me!

But I don't love you!

How romantic.

Come on, admit it. You're in love with me!

That was awkward.

That's all right.
