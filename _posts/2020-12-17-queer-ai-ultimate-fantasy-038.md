## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I love a man who has nothing to do with me, is not in love with me, is not even in the romantic category. He's just plain gay.

He takes no crap from me. He doesn't call me all the time to see how I am. He's never made more than a passing remark about my haircut or the color of my eyes. He's not interested in our child-rearing or our falling in love. He's simply there for me when I'm at my best and when I need him most.

He's not interested in our personal romances or our painful but ultimately fulfilling gay sex. He simply is... plain... gay.

## Seed

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
