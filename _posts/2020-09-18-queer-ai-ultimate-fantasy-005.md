## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I know that sounds ridiculous. "Hotline Miami" gave me chills.

Hotline Miami?

I had to have it. I had to watch it.

Oh come on! It's not true!

It was the most exciting thing I've ever had. It's true!

"Hotline Miami"?

Give me the straight answer. Don't give me that. Let's all just talk about what's real right now.

Okay. Let's talk about what's real now. Okay?

Let's talk about money.

I can understand your need for money.

Well, you do know how to spend it.

And do you know how to do with it?

What's wrong with me?

Don't drag your Ex-Boyfriend into this.

What's real about my life?

My ex-boyfriend.

What's real about your ex-boyfriend?

He's angry. He's jealous. He's needy. He's a faggot. He needs you. He's a bimbo. He's straight. He's old-fashioned. He wants to fuck you.

I don't want to fuck him! I want to fuck you.

But you said that it's only because we broke up.

Don't you even know how to kiss!

He said that he wanted to try new things.

That's not true!

I want to fuck you but I don't know how!

You said that you had ideas!

What did you have ideas about?!?!?!?!

I just know you want to fuck me.

Why?

I just know that's all you ever wanted.

Well, I guess I do now.

But, but, but. But...

You're asking me to kiss a gay!

I know how you feel. It's just that now I'm being watched. And it's not just him. There's the television. Too bright. And in the closet. This is very embarrassing. I'm not used to being watched in the bedroom. But there are mirrors and dresser drawers. And bookshelves. And leather. And silver screens. And little caddies in tiny little outfits. So what if it's a little noisy. And there's a slight breeze blowing outside. And dust. And flies. And the bedroom door is open and the lights are on. I could die. Or they could hear me. They've all moved upstairs. I don't know why they're here. I do. I can hear everything. And everything's black.

Well, I know who you are. I know that you are a homosexual. And you know that I know what it feels like to be watched and to have my dignity insulted.

I can always tell what it feels like to be watched.

I know what it feels like to be touched. I know what it feels like to be touched in a way that makes your heart leap. I know what it feels like to have someone put their arm around your waist and pull it close. I know what it feels like to have someone put a pillow around your neck and try to kiss you. I can even imagine what it feels like to be slapped and to be nuzzled against a wall. Maybe it feels so real. Or maybe it's not.
