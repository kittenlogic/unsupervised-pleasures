## Human Prompt

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .

## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college, I came home from a party with a really horny high school senior who kept telling me how he and his friend Jake were planning to have a "Boy Love Night."

As I related this story to my friend, she blurted out, "What's so funny?"

I thought for a moment, then said,
"He's straight!"

And
"How are they going to get it up in here?"

And
And
"How are they planning to get it up?"

And

I felt my jaw drop open.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to denigrate any of those relationships. But there are aspects that struck me as particularly perverted.

Guys, I have a confession to make.

It's late, I'm exhausted, I've got dinner to go, and I just want to be alone with my most sexual desire.

This is it. We've all got to turn on the lights. Please join me.

This is the part of the show where I explain to you why my ex-boyfriend and I have been lovers since the day we first laid eyes on each other.

It has always been my dream to have my very own private lesbian bar. The only problem is, there aren't any bars in this town.

Oh, there are bars! Such as in Atlanta and San Francisco, where Queer Rebels meets every third Thursday. And in New York City, we are soon to have our very own dedicated lesbian karaoke night club, Les Belle Journeys.

In Los Angeles there's the now-defunct, now-defunct ymag, and soon-to-be-defunct Dyke March. Meanwhile in San Francisco, the long-vacant Golden Gate Park is home to The Village Lesbian Comedy Theater, a weekly, all-ages stand-up club.
It's time for my very own dedicated queer cabaret club.

Where the hell are these other queer bars? You all think they're great. I could never get into any of these bars in my wild youth. Where are the other queer cabarets?
Saul?

My very own dedicated queer karaoke night club.

As I waited in a cab for my turn, passing gay bars and clubs that were as gay as the day they were created, I could hear the conversation going on in my cab.

Ooh, newscaster impressions! Queer Prophet is opening its office in a gayborhood!
