Let me tell you about my ultimate fantasy. I was thirteen when I discovered Total Recall. I remember being in the coffee shop one day, and all of a sudden the coffee was empty and the only thing around was a half-naked man in a pajama top. And there was this other guy sitting there too, and he wasn't naked either. And he had these animal-shaped eyes, and he wasn't human either. And they weren't talking to each other, either. And there wasn't even a fucking car. And there wasn't even any coffee in the cup. And there wasn't even a fucking truck either. And I just freaked out and freaked out real bad. And I started crying because there were no buttons on the cups or on the tops of the trays. And I started putting my things away and heading back inside. And the next day, after I had calmed down a bit, I went back inside and bought all my clothes off the list and threw them in the washing machine. Do you have any idea how many times I got told that this was a fantasy when I was thirteen? And that scared the shit out of me.

## Seed

“Dude, we were so gay in this film, so gay!” While it is comforting to know that the dudes understand that they were participating in a queer universe, the DVD makes clear that this was a temporary state of affairs and that both dudes are now safely secured for and by the heterosexual matrix. So while the film’s queerness cannot be located at the level of identity, we can argue for queerness as a set of spatialized relations that are permitted through the white male’s stupidity, his disorientation in time and space.

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
