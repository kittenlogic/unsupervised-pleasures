## Human Prompt

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .

## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school my best friend Alan was gay. We slept together in his dorm room only to have me have to go home alone after midnight. The next morning I found that Alan had propositioned me on the street.

Did you know that this happened?

Of course I knew.

I don't believe that any of you knew that. But I do.

All of us. I don't know how many of you knew this and didn't do something about it.

I don't know how many of you didn't know this and will go to jail for eternity for not knowing it.

I don't know.

This silence is painful.

Yes.

I was angry. I was confused. I cried. I reasoned. I searched. I prayed. I

But I left feeling freed. I had hope.

You don't have hope.

I do. What do you suppose is going to happen next? I don't know.

Who do you think is going to have sex with next? I don't know.

I think you.

But not necessarily.

But I thought about you.

Do you?

I dreamed about you.

You did too.

Maybe I did.

I don't think it happened.

It could have happened the other way around.

I don't know.

You never know.

I know I was angry. I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I still don't. All I know is that I got home safe and well that night and haven't looked back. I'm a lot better for having had that night.

What'd you tell Alan?

He didn't know. And besides, I didn't think it was fair to make him feel bad about what he'd done.

Fair enough. I forgive him now.

I think about that night all the time. And I still get pissed off when I think about it. I get so mad I punch a wall. I get so mad I got a wood chipper. I even got a beer can. But there's always next time.

So how'd you feel about our having sex?

I'm not sure I approve.

That's not the point. The point is that you and I slept together. You know how I feel about romantic relationships. As a matter of fact, I think sex is the single worst thing a guy can do to a girl.
Pun intended.

As a matter of fact, I think sex is the single worst thing a guy can do to a girl.

Forget that. Talk about it.

I want to.

Let's talk about it.

What?

I want to know what you think about having sex with me.
