Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was making love to you. It was over moon rockin in the dark with the moon just barely in the sky. Stars were dancing across the brilliant night sky. In a blur I pictured you sitting there, arms outspread, enjoying the view, your legs spread apart apart, completely nude from the lighting. There was just one problem. There was no starlight.

Did you hear the one about how stars don't glow because they're full of static? Well, that was true then, and it is true now. Most of us just give up on stars when they get too crowded... or are too bright. We settle for the halo effect... or the twinkling of an orange.

I want to go to a secluded spot where I can let my imagination run wild. Let it happen. Even in New Orleans it happens.

I want to go to a secluded spot on a wooden pier where the waves crash against the side of a cliff, and the water is so cold I could melt in it.

I want to go to the edge of a lake where the waves crash against the metal deck, and the wind is so strong that the sail of a ship can be seen twirling in the air.

I want to take my clothes off in the moonlight and float naked across the cold waters of the Dead Sea.
