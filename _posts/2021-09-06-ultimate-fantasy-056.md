Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.<br/>
My idealized idealized sexual partner.<br/>
Imagine me. My lover.<br/>
Me and you in the Amazon.<br/>
We meet in a bar.<br/>
We go to a gay bar.<br/>
And I fall in love.<br/>

Orgasm<br/>
After<br/>
We have sex.

Orgasm<br/>
After<br/>
Kissing.

Orgasm<br/>
After<br/>
I fall in love.

The love object.

No, really.<br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
Maybe we do.<br/>
Wait, let me think.<br/>
Maybe we don't.<br/>
Maybe we did.

Whatever the fuck you want to call it, I fell in love with you the way you wanted me to, the way you said you wanted me.

For three days I could tell you were falling in love, but the love never stopped.<br/>
My love never stopped either.<br/>
My skin crawled all over.<br/>
When I finally did go to the hospital I told them I had AIDS.<br/>
You still love me, love.<br/>
And I was in the emergency room.
