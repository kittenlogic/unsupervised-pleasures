Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.<br/>
My idealized idealized sexual partner.<br/>
Imagine me. My lover.<br/>
Me and you in the Amazon.<br/>
We meet in a bar.<br/>
We go to a gay bar.<br/>
And I fall in love.<br/>

Orgasm<br/>
After<br/>
We have sex.

Orgasm<br/>
After<br/>
Kissing.

Orgasm<br/>
After<br/>
I fall in love.

The love object.

No, really.<br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
Maybe we do.<br/>
Wait, let me think.<br/>
Maybe we don't.<br/>
Maybe we did.

Whatever the fuck you want to call it, I fell in love with you the way you wanted me to, the way you said you wanted me.

For three days I could tell you were falling in love, but the love never stopped.<br/>
My love never stopped either.<br/>
My skin crawled all over.<br/>
When I finally did go to the hospital I told them I had AIDS.<br/>
You still love me, love.<br/>
And I was in the emergency room.

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
