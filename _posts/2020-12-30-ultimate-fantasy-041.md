Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

He takes her to his place. She takes the elevator up. He goes through the bedroom door. She becomes aware of LIL J. They kiss. He goes into the bathroom. She becomes aware of JOSHUA. They embrace. They go into the bedroom. She becomes aware of KITTY. She removes her hand from JOSHUA's neck. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She pulls her pants up. She becomes aware of RITA. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She pulls her pants up. She becomes aware of JOSHUA. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She becomes aware of KITTY. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She becomes aware of RITA. She lies down on the bed. She pants.

Lil and Joshua have sex.

Lil J awakens at 4 a.m. to a phone call from KITTY.

I wish I could have kept you, honey. I miss you so much.

I love you too.

You gave your life to make someone else feel better. That is what true love is.

I'm glad you feel that way.

No more phone sex please.

A phone sex alert?

Who would ever want a Larry Merchant-sized dick in their mouth after that?

I want this a lot.

May I have the number?

The number is a bonus on my next book.

Hi!

May I use it please?

Hello?

Hi.

From the library.

Yeah. I mean, hi.

Great. Great. So how'd you do last night?

I didn't do very well. I don't usually hang around bars after dark.

That's okay. So, tell me about yourself.

I'm a writer. Just not very good at it.

And what drew you to the theater?

I had a shrink once. He was a playwright I knew and trusted. And I figured if I could get laid free of his yokel bullshit, maybe I could write my own book.

Not your book.

No! Look, I just remembered I have to be up front with Kitty about what I do. I'm not the straight woman you think I am.

Then act like it.

What do you mean?

Act like Kitty. You know I won't lie to you.

Kitty would be proud.

Not if it meant telling her about me fucking a shrink.

Can you imagine me doing that to my wife?

I love you so much.

Why didn't you tell me that you and Kitty hooked up on the phone?

Because... well, because, that's how it turned out.

That's a great way to start a story.

Well, maybe we could go on a date.
