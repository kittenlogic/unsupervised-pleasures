## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was your age, in college, cruising the interwebs, cruising the high school, cruising high schools.... There was one boy,

Hey, buddy, we got to go to your place.

Hang in there, Johnny.

Hair of the dog?

Butch. How could he be gay? How could he be my friend?

You and I were besties. We went to the same high school.

What happened?

You left me.

And I threw you out of your best friend's party.

What happened?

I didn't think much of it.

It happened over and over. You and I.

I threw him out of my best friend's party.

You're a great friend.

You're trash.

Okay. I'm sorry. I don't belong here. Please.

No!

No!

No!




Hair of the dog?

Look, Johnny, I don't know what to do. It's your fault. I didn't know. I don't know. I can't do anything. It's your fault. It's your fault. You want to talk about it. I'm sitting here, waiting for you to tell me something and you don't.

Let's not talk about it.

It's not your fault. I didn't know. And I'm not your friend.



Heather, you know I love you. But I know that sometimes you're too rough on me or too direct with me. And that you need to be a little more subtle. You are too good for me. I don't know where else to go. I don't know what to do.

Johnny, I love you too. But you're not perfect. You're not perfect, Honeybun. And you're not just a friend. You're a brother.

I'm not a fucking brother!

You need a friend to go with you when you make these kinds of crazy plans.

I don't need a friend!

I'm not a fucking runaway!

You need to be with someone for a while. Okay?

Yes.

You can stay here with me.

I need a friend to go with me.

I need a friend to go to bars and clubs with.

I don't need a friend.

Then you have to tell me.

I don't need a friend. I don't need a friend. I don't.

Okay! I'm going.



Okay! You're going!

I'm going to a party with some guys tonight.

What'll we do?

Do you want to see the strippers or what?

And I'll show you. Do you want to see the housewife or the stay-at-home mother?

I'll tell you what'll show you.

Do you want to see a lesbian or a naturist?

I'll show you.



A naked woman in a house.

The party goes on.

I want to see the naked woman.



A naked man.

The party doesn't go on.

I want to see the housewife or the stay-at-home mother.



I'll be seeing you tonight.

I'll be seeing you sometime.



Okay. You and Johnny. Now go.

I'm going!



I don't know, I'm not feeling so good.

Don't go around asking me where I'm going.



You and I are best buddies.

It's alright.

I've got to go.

Why?

I don't know. Don't go around asking me why.



So what're you going to do?

You're going to the party.

I really don't know what to do.

I'm going. I'm going to a party with some guys.

You and me. Go to the bars.

I've never been in a bar with anyone.

A party? Oh. Well, that's nice. I'll see you after the show.



Sure. Where are you going?

Hair of the dog? I know you.

Do you like to show off?

I like to keep my clothes in the closet. "Fancy a pet?"

I've always wanted a housewife. Now I've got one.

A pet?

A cat.

A cat. I like cats.

I don't know. I think I like big cats.

You're a very big cat.

I don't know. I'm frightened of big cats.

Oh. That's right. You're a very big cat.

Do you have a lot of friends?

Not really. We do quite a bit.

Not really.

I'm a very big cat!



A lot of people like to be big. You're very popular.

Well, this is a very big house.

Do you have a lot of friends?

Not really.

Oh. I'm very popular.

Well, I don't know if I do. I don't know if I do.

Well, if you were really famous, people would come to your rescue.

Really? What would people say about me now?

People say that about everybody that I meet. I meet them and go.
