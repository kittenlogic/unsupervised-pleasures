Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. <br/>
That my desire for you lies somewhere in the middle of both<br/>
in my desire for John and in the desire I have for your body.<br/>
Inferiori.<br/>
Inferiori. I want my desire to lie between the cushions of my thighs and fill your hand with my own moist hair.<br/>
What would that look like?<br/>
I'd like it if it were a handkerchief.<br/>
It has to be something soft, something that slides up my wrist so I can touch it without making myself wet. <br/>
I love when you put your hand on my hip and I can feel the warmth, the dampness, of your skin against my back.<br/>
I just want to kiss you.<br/>
I want you to move your hand away from my hip and cup my cheek.<br/>
I want you to pull away from me.<br/>
I want you to smother me.<br/>
I am drowning.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized.1 If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
