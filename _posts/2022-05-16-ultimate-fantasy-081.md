Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Ah, fantasy. It has nothing to do with whether you are heterosexual or homosexual. If you can keep it up long enough, I'll be able to keep up with you. So let's begin.

My specialty is the disappearing. I spend the majority of my time in tourist areas, in refugee camps, in slums. I like to travel the world, and I think that the world should be my world. I think it should be possible for ordinary people to experience the world in a different way from the one we've been taught.  

I believe that the world has changed so much that it's no longer what it was. Traditional values no longer apply. We have no values left. All we have is sex. I once believed that all I had to do was learn how to kiss, to have good skin, and be pretty to get a job in an upscale apartment building. Now, I wonder if maybe that's what I was taught. Maybe it was all part of the price of being a good Indian.

In any case, my specialty is in the areas of "Lost Cities." These days, the main tourist spots are Bangkok and Durban. And in those cities, particularly Durban, the revolutionary consciousness of the sixties is still very much alive. People still revere the old king.

That's one of the most striking things about cities. People still have their houses. They still have their livestock. They still have their values. Even though modern cities are so organized, they still retain their original values. The peasants still have their land. Traditional values still hold true.

I went there once. There was a big party. Everybody was dressed in green, and there were thousands of people. Suddenly, there were wild fires burning in the sky. Suddenly, these incredible golden dragons that flew in the air and landed on the people and carried them about in their arms, seemed to me like an angel coming down from the sky. And I thought to myself, "Now, that's how powerful these elements are."

We mustn't lose sight of the fact that these elements are also the vehicles for the reconstitution of the social order. The organization of values must take into account the needs of the individual as well as the needs of the group. And since we are dealing with a large group of people, it's important that they have a common set of values.

What do you mean?

Here, the organization of values has the greatest significance. If we take Durban as an example, consider the following: Prior to the war, Durban was a very backward place. Prior to the war, it was practically unknown to the English. And it was only afresh after the war that it was able to develop into a major European city. The cities of Europe after the war were much more developed. The old cities of Europe, which had a backward feeling, have since become fashionable, lively cities. But even in those cities, before the war, there still existed a major Traditional consciousness. Traditional values were really not so important. Today, all that's left are the values of the International Brigades, the C.I.A. and the like. And even here there are still major Traditional values.

Hello?... That woman in front of me, she's a member of the International Brigades?

The C.I.A. has a very important function in Africa. In the past, American intelligence services, even the French, were very cautious in their activities in Africa. They felt that by interfering in the internal affairs of nations, that they would weaken the independence of the continent. But today, Washington doesn't hesitate to send its best agents into countries to overthrow the government.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
