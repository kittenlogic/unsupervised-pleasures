Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

It has always been my dream to have my very own private lesbian bar. The only problem is, there aren't any bars in this town.

Oh, there are bars! Such as in Atlanta and San Francisco, where Queer Rebels meets every third Thursday. And in New York City, we are soon to have our very own dedicated lesbian karaoke night club, Les Belle Journeys.

In Los Angeles there's the now-defunct ymag, and soon-to-be-defunct Dyke March. Meanwhile in San Francisco, the long-vacant Golden Gate Park is home to The Village Lesbian Comedy Theater, a weekly, all-ages stand-up club.

It's time for my very own dedicated queer cabaret club. My very own dedicated queer karaoke night club.

Where the hell are these other queer bars? You all think they're great. I could never get into any of these bars in my wild youth. Where are the other queer cabarets?

As I waited in a cab for my turn, passing gay bars and clubs that were as gay as the day they were created, I could hear the conversation going on in my cab.

Ooh, newscaster impressions! Queer Prophet is opening its office in a gayborhood!

## Human Prompt
