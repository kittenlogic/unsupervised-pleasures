Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Stop masturbating.<br/>
Stop saying you want to.<br/>
Stop using words like "orientation" and even the feminine "bi" in your sex-positive marketing.<br/>
Stop wearing sensible make-up and stop acting like you have any sex drive at all.<br/>
Stop eating junk food and drink lots of water.<br/>
Stop having casual sex.<br/>
Stop wearing tight clothing.<br/>
Stop letting your hair grow out.<br/>
Stop laughing when you see people in gay porn.<br/>
Stop using the word "gay" in your sex-positive marketing.<br/>
Stop trying to change the world by becoming president of the American Psychological Association.<br/>
Stop being a good mother.<br/>
Stop being a good friend.<br/>
