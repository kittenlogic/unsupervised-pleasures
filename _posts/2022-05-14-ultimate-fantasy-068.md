Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Areas of Concentration.

1 Practice makes perfect. Here I am, practice makes perfect. All at once. Perfection in motion. My entire life has gone by in that matter of a few seconds. But that's another story.

2 Concentration. My practice today is going to be all about becoming more and more concentrated. As I breathe out, I want you to think of me in blue sheets and want me in white chairs. I want you to imagine me perfectly draped in white sheets and then to imagine that idealized image on the white surface of a coffee table. Just imagine it. Maybe it's me in a blue sheet under a blue star. Maybe it's me on a white beach in the middle of a party. Maybe it's even me in a party in which I have drunk hundreds of cups of coffee. But whatever you imagine, think of me perfectly draped in white and my hands all over you. And as I relax into this image, imagine the coffee in my hand and the blue of my sheet caressing my naked body. It's going to feel so good. I want you to imagine me perfectly relaxed, my whole body quivering with the desire to show you just how perfectly I am.

Will I let myself drift further into sensual slumber as your fingers trace along my hip? Will my thighs quiver as you run your fingertips along my lined button-holes? Will my breasts jiggle as you fondle them? Will my skin crackle with a primal call to arms that has nothing to do with fatigue or lack of nourishment? Will my hair stand on end as you stroke my head and caress the back of my neck? Will my eyelids flutter shut as you fondle the sides of my face? Will my chest rise as you press against my sternum, and will my hair fall in waves as it drips onto the cold sheet?

When you are finished, I want you to put your hand on my hip and pull me toward you. You will see more than I have in the last three months. You will feel more than I have in the last year.

I don't think you have a monopoly on desire.

Nonsense. My students have been known to squander energy chasing after imaginary white sheets. Imagination is just a good guess, practice makes perfect.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
