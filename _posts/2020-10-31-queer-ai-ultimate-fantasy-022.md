## Human Prompt

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .

## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, I had the epiphany that none of these ways were real.

There's always one thing you never tell.

One thing?

About yourself.

How could I not? My secret is out. Everybody knows. And it may even be true. I don't give a fuck.

That's bull. Trust me. I practically beg you not to. I've never been so sure of a thing in my life. I even went as far as to call my father, the head cheerleader, and broach the subject with him in person. He was apolitical at best, but not unreasonably so. He told me the story of how Jimi Hendrix died, and how his body was hung from a noose attached to a tree. No one would believe it, of course, and no one would go near the graveyard until someone pointed it out to them, and then it was gone. No one would take the noose apart to see if it was a handkerchief or a pair of tweezers. No one would believe me until it was too late. I finally spoke up, and explained that I had been growing suspicious of certain aspects of certain people I was in relationships with. I couldn't bring myself to lie to them, and so I told them the whole story. I was wrong. I had been lying all along.

Bullshit.
