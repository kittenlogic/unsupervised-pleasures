Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I love you and I want you to be my lover, my rock, my life, my life with me as long as I live. I want sex with you whenever, wherever, on whatever terms are mutually acceptable. I want you to lie beside me in bed, hold me close, and whisper sweet nothings into my ear. Kiss me gently on the forehead, lick me on the cheek, nuzzle my hair.

No!

Then go on. I want you to undo my fly buttons. Pull my blouse down. Pull my underwear all the way down. Pull my sex toy between our legs. Dry me.

No!

I want you to finger fuck me. Fiddle with my clit. Bite my nipples.

No!

I want to feel you push me onto the bed. I want to feel you stick your dick into me. I want to rock on my back, to squirm in my jeans as you fuck me. I want you to turn me over on my stomach and grind against me. I want to feel you rim my pussy with your cock. I want you to slip your dick inside me. I want you to pound me until I am screaming.

No!

I want all of this for you. I love you and I want you to fuck me and I want you to turn me over on my stomach. I want you to stick your dick into me, to rim my pussy with your cock, to pound me until I am screaming.

No!

What are you so scared of? That one queer might hear you, see you, touch you. That one might walk by and make eye contact. What if they got a peek? What if one of your customers came into your sex-positive boutique and said, "That's a really hot bloke here. He talks dirty." Or, "I bet he fucks teenage girls on the street corners." Or, "He says he likes big cocks."

I want all of this for you.

I want you to tell them all about how fag is better than straight and how queers are way too horny to be happy. I want you to make them queers proud of themselves. I want you to change the conversation.

Look, you've got me.

I've always wanted you to change the conversation. That's why I came up here today. To change the conversation. And I've got my ace up my sleeve.

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
