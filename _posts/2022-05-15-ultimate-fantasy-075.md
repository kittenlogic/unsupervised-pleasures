Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It is the kind of fantasy that leads me to believe that the very basis of all reality is a magic carpet of love and desire that is pulled in a million directions at once, weaving us into a tapestry that we can unravel and add to at will.

First Love

The carpet of love is so thick and so rich that it encompasses the infinite splendor of all things, and it is here that I find the secret of my power. I'm talking about the inner being that is the center of the universe, the Supreme Being. That's right. Imagine your inner being is a perfectly ordinary little man, about your size, pretty, good at sports, dull, but infinitely loving.

If you squint hard enough, you can see that his bedroom walls are lined with photographs of perfectly ordinary people he has slept with. He calls them friends. He calls them family. He has them over for dinner, brings gifts, takes vacations, holds concerts, cooks for the group, cleans up after themselves, holds seminars, teaches classes, runs the house, and does almost anything to please them all.

One night, he notices a young man sitting cross-legged in a window seat by the bed. The young man, his face expressionless, has on a white suit, white sneakers, and is wearing a white tie. The young man looks at the two men in the window and then at the white-suited stranger. The stranger awakens and approaches the two men, puts his hand on the young man's shoulder, and says in a singsong voice, "Hush, I'm waiting for you here, my friend. Take care of me, I'm waiting."

Okay. Someone else has to play the part of the suitor and the rejected partner. So I'll call this other person a Host. I'll call him the Other Half. I'll set up the tableaux so that the Host and the Other Half are playing the roles of the two lovers and the hotel guest.<br/>
There already is a tension here that I want you to unpack.<br/>
There is?<br/>
Well, I already get a headache about this. The Host has invested a great deal of energy in trying to woo this person. He has written beautiful love poems to this person.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
