Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I grew up in Kentucky. My father was a doctor.

Well, that's a pretty good background to have.

It's not much, if you ask me.

You know, I like the Kentucky scenery.

That's true. It makes me happy.

And when I'm driving down the highway, I like to imagine what it would be like if you could see me. There's a sort of suburban fantasy in Kentucky. It's not too far from town. It's beautiful.

I'm not into that type of thing. I don't like suburban scenery.

You don't?

I like scenery. That's what I like to see. I'm in a hurry. I have to be in a hurry.

You're about to drive.

I'm driving.

Welcome to Kentucky.

Be my guest.

With me?

Absolutely.

Your car?

My new convertible. It's got heated front seats, power windows, leather upholstery, power sunroof, moonroof... and a 5.2-speakers, big-screen surround sound, and a six-point sun map.

Oh.

And heated sunroof and moonroof and 4-wheel drive.

I was going to have an affair with this beautiful lady. My fantasies are not limited to your country.

Not my country.

I was just going to say... I like the look of her.

Beautiful?

Yes. Tamed. Comfortable. Smart. Not demanding.

I'm not demanding.

I was just going to say... I could care less if you're black, gay, brown, or whatever your assigned sex at school is.

Be firm. I'm not here to judge.

I am a sexologist. My name is Dr. Ben Carson. I have done thousands of studies on human sexuality. And I can tell you from personal experience that the vast majority of men and women who find satisfaction in sex, desire it the same way you do.

Bullshit!

Maybe they do. Maybe they don't. But whatever the reason, most men and most women are far from satisfied with their sex lives. They want more than that.

Want more than that?

Excuse me?

A "want more than that." This attitude is repellent to millions of men and women who want to be loved, safe, and happy.

I never asked you.

So what would you have done if I had asked you? You would have told me to fuck off. I wouldn't have, wouldn't I?

Would you want me to fuck you anyway?

Maybe that's the kind of guy you are. You are repulsive to me. You are repulsive to me because...

I am not repulsive to you. You are repulsive to me because you...

I can't get past that.

Bullshit.

Try it.

You see? It's like that. It goes with the territory.

If you'll notice, I'm not finished.

If I may ask a question

Would you ever...

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
