Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .

## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young I loved going out to a club with a gang of boys. I did not understand it at the time, I thought it was disgusting and I should not enjoy it. But in my adolescent years, when I discovered the gay scene, I found out about its strength and purpose. This meant it had two forms, boys and men. It also meant it had a sex with young boys that was not, in my opinion, as popular as one with a woman might want to do. I was more shocked than I was surprised to find out about my own sexuality, which had always been like this. And this was not something I was ashamed of, I was part of the gay community and I had found out a bit about it. I would occasionally go to clubs with boys, or with my mother. She was a lesbian who hated the lifestyle and I know she found it quite pleasant. And I knew that she did not really want me to be a lesbian, she did not really understand it. My mother was a staunch member of the "G" club, which was devoted to women. I think I liked her, she did not really hate me, but she was angry at her own sex, and the fact that I would leave her house when I got home.


I came home late one night and my mother was furious at me. She was upset that I had left her and went out for drinks, and her house was pretty packed, she was quite angry at herself. She and her husband, who was a Presbyterian, were at a pub the night before. I was the only boy there and I was alone, but she saw me coming in. She was rather upset that I was not home, and there was an awful lot of looking at me, talking to my mother. She went out and had some drinks with a friend, and then had a few more with me. She then left for the pub. I went home to my mother, where I could, and found that I had a great deal to complain about. I was going to go to bed and she went off to see my friend. It was a pretty dark evening, dark with the smell of smoke. She called the police and came over to my room. I thought it was dreadful. I saw my friend there and she wanted to see me. She was so happy to see me. I explained to her that I was going to go back to my room. She went off to find her friend. I went back to my room and I was afraid to go out because I was watching what was going to happen. But she was a very good friend and told me not to go out at night. She would give me her handbag and I would carry her and her bag. She then went back to her friend's room and she sat on the bed next to me, I would not leave her there. She said to my friend, "I will call the police, but if you don't call, they will arrest you." And so I went back to my room. And I had an awkward silence and I went and sat down to write. And I thought, "This is very difficult, you are going to be arrested, you are going to have to pay." She came out and said, "Good, it is quite easy to say."

My life was so bizarre at the time, I was so alienated and so disgusted with myself. But I got out of it, I got over it, and I never had any more time to write.

I never did it again. I can see that I have had many adventures.


Do you think that's why it isn't fashionable in the gay world?

Well, I don't think that gay people are boring people. I think that they are sometimes very strong and very intense, and I don't think that they are the boring kind of people. They are not boring and they do have a desire to be interesting, but not too interesting and not too interesting. I think that there are things to be said about the gay community which are not in the strict or the conventional way.


Do you think the gay community is becoming a bit like the gay ideal, which has been reduced to some trifle by those who are more in touch with the gay community?

Yes, I think it is becoming more and more like that. It is not a perfect solution. The gay community is like a vast bouquet of flowers, and it's just like that. It is a lot of things, and it is a very large bouquet. The lesbian community is a big bouquet, and it's still about flowers. But it's becoming less and less and less bouquet and more and more bouquet.


How does the gay community differ from the lesbian community?

I think that there is a great difference between them. The gay community is a community of real people, who are full of love, and they are passionate and not egocentric, and that is what is interesting to the lesbian community.


What do you think gay people are about?

Well, I think that they are fantastic people, and it would be quite a bit interesting to know how they are about. They are not an aesthetic problem. They have a great deal of talent, and you don't want to find out what they are about.


You seem to have a rather positive attitude towards people, despite the tragedy of your experiences.

Yes, but I am never close to someone, and I think I have gone through enough. It is one thing when you have lived through tragedy. It is another thing when you have been married and have had children. I always think that it would be quite a good idea to meet someone who is the same age as me. I think it is quite useful. It would be a pity to find out that I was one of the things I did not like.


What was your family like?

I think it was all very peaceful and nice. I had a nice wife and I had a nice home and all that. I was only a little girl. And they were very nice to me.


You have a big family, have you ever got on a train?

No, not really.


What's your first job like?

I used to work as a stenographer. I am actually a stenographer.


Are you still a stenographer?

No, I am working as a nurse.


Is your time spent as a stenographer something you like?

No, not at all.


It's not your favorite thing?

It's the most amazing and the most challenging job you have ever had.


Do you think you have lived up to the definition of a married woman?

Well, if I was a married woman, I wouldn't want to do anything. But if I was an adult woman I would do it if it was my husband, or my children. I think it's just a bit silly.


What are your ambitions for your future?

Well, I think I am pretty much done for. I have a wife, I have a nice home and I don't have any plans. I think that I am an interesting person and I think I have a lot to tell you about.


Have you met people?

I have, but not quite yet.


What is your next adventure?

I don't know.

I was in a garden party and I went down and met an old man who was dying of cancer. He was very kind to me and he was asking me how I was doing.

He said: "Goodbye, darling, you are much prettier now than you were at the party."

I did not know what a garden party was. I thought it was just a party.


Why would he come down and meet you?

Well, he said: "I must tell you that I am very sad, and that is the best way I can express my feelings. I am on my death bed. I don't know if I can live anymore. And, for my part, I must tell you that I am sorry." I said: "Yes, I understand."


What did he say?

"I am very sorry. It seems that I have lost my voice. I am so sorry. I hope I never lose it again."


What did you say?

"Goodbye, darling. It is my last time with you."


You haven't spoken to him in a while.

No, not yet.


Do you know if he knows you?

I know what he says.


Do you think you could help him?

No, not yet. I don't think he is that interested in you.


Are you lonely?

No, not really.


Do you think you are going to stay with him?

I don't know. I have not talked to him in a while.

I know he is going to come back.


He is going to come back?

I hope not.


But what does he want?

He has just come back from Europe.


Did you have a talk with him?

I don't know, not since I have been away.


Do you know if he wants you back?

I don't know, but I would not be embarrassed to think so.


What's your new office number?

My office is there.

I've been told that.

I don't know.


Are you staying in your apartment or are you in your house?

I am staying in my house.


Do you have any other house to live in?
