Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I've narrowed it down to three broad broad groups:
Biphobia. Lesbianism. Androgyny.

As I go through these please think of the people you didn't even know were queers.

Biphobia. Biphobia is when a person's attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on stereotypes, stereotypes that are not based on reality. For example, some people think that if they are gay they cant get laid because they're too feminine. This is called the Biphobia effect.

Orphobia. Orphobia is when a person's attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on the idea of the sacred or sacred gender. For example, some people think that if they are priests they cant get laid because they're too masculine. This is called the Orphobia effect.

Orphobia and Androphobia. Orphobia and Androphobia are usually in conflict. For example, some people may have very strong or very weak attraction to both men and women. Orphobia can also lead to the idea that a person may or may not be gay.

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
