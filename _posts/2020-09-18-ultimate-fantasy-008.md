Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I've never been in a room with anyone who thought, "Oh, this person is very interesting, I could be very interesting."

You have no idea what it's like to be unattractive. It's hell.

You have no idea what it is like to be unattached. And very, very dense. And very, very stupid.

You have no idea what it is to be hungry. And very, very possessive. And very, very competitive.

Do you like to show off?

I like to keep my clothes in the closet. I get so excited about things. I get so excited I want to go out and beat the shit out of this corner store, this little orphan shop, this theatre, this park, this sign, this flower, this mirror, this telephone booth, this carpet, this life, this book, this chair, this street, this walkway, this lamp, this tree, this brick, this table, this rug, this blanket.

I've never been in a room with anyone who has said to me, "You are very interesting."

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .
