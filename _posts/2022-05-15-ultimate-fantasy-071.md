Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.<br/>
What would you like to say to someone who has never seen a blue whale?<br/>
Now, I don't think that those twenty-five thousand people ever saw blue whales again. I think they just got fat with those kinds of animals. Now, I'm no expert on the subject,<br/>
But whales are large. They weigh hundreds of tons. And they take tens of thousands of years to grow to adult size. So maybe you and I could go back in time and go back in time and eat a baby whale.<br/>
That's a mouthful.<br/>
Just let me finish.<br/>
Wait. I have something else to tell you. The blue whale has taken a virgin. Yes? What is it? You guessed it.<br/>
A doubloon.<br/>
A doubloon what, exactly?<br/>
A fertilized egg.<br/>
A fertilized egg. That's what they're called. Floating city eggs. You see, these things, these things we call "doubloons," they're not babies at all. They're little round bastards.

Well then, lets make a baby.<br/>
Cut it in half lengthwise. One half is the embryo, the other the placenta. Now, take one end of the embryo and sew it round the outside of the olives. Then place the cut end under the broiler and roast for fifteen minutes, till golden brown. Then remove the broil and serve. Garnish with sea salt.<br/>
Well then, here's the baby.<br/>
Dab some turpentine on the end so it glows.<br/>
Silk purse. Needle and thread.<br/>
A blue whale is so huge, you cant see its eyes. You can though you can't quite see its mouth.<br/>
How huge is a blue whale?<br/>
Um, not a whole lot. A real pain in the ass to pull a blue whale.<br/>
Well now, you'll never guess what it looks like.<br/>
A real pain in the ass to pull a blue whale.<br/>
Twenty-five thousand blue whales a day are killed in the ocean.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized.1 If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
