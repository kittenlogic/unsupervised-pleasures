Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I have this island up there in the Atlantic Ocean, and up there I will sail my lover, my white Antarctic wanderer in a drift along the beach, and we will both be safe from the elements and from the elements' mirrors and will be free of the elements as much as the elements will be free of us. We will both be safe from the elements because I will be protected by the elements and because the safety I will enjoy will be directly dependent on the safety of my lover.

Can you imagine me up there on that rock watching the sunset and saying to myself, "That was worth it," or do you want me up there on that sand in the surf, saying to myself, "Just because I smell fish doesn't make me a fisher," or do you want me up there in a cabin up there on a tree with a log sticking out of my chest and having sex with the world around us, with the coconut trees and the palms and the wildflowers drifting in the breeze?

Just because I like to imagine it. I want to sail down that beach one day and not be afraid at all. I want to have my cake and eat it too.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
