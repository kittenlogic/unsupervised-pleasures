Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Forget dreams.<br/>
Leave me alone! I will scream when you come into my room at night, as I have during times of crisis. I will yank on your bedsheets, trying to force my way in. I will turn on the lights and you will be too cold to sleep!

Wake up!<br/>
It has happened to me. I was young, bright, beautiful. All of a sudden, I was cold, distant, defeated. I had no energy, no drive. I was a walkover.

It has happened to you. You let yourself get numb and defenseless, letting fear take over, your heart pumping away, your mind racing, your will broken. There is no will, no energy, just nerves, blood, and hard-earned suntan oil.

Are you trying to tell me something?

Sometimes dreams are a warning. They remind us of things to come.


## Seed

What happens when you stop dreaming? When you can longer see a future for yourself, for those you love, for all of the sentient and non-sentient beings on this planet? When day after day you grieve? When day after day you feel your senses dull, your feelings numb, your spirit shrinking and withering away? When time spirals into a personal hell of your own distorted mind maps and trauma loops? When you can no longer receive the light of love? When your heart stops emanating its own light?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
