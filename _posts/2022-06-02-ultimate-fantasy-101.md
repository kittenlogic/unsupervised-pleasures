Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.<br/>
I am the courier who brings Jesus back to life.<br/>
Is that really happening?<br/>
I am the whip that drives out demons.<br/>
Are you a prophet?<br/>
I am the lamp that shines a thousand new candles.

You can live in a house of illusions, you can have a house of dreams, you can have a garden of illusions, and all you have to worry about is who's watching.<br/>
So this is how it all began.<br/>
You're still here?

Dessert!<br/>
I'll have orange juice.

Yeah, I'd better go. I can't stay.<br/>
I'll see you later.

They start having sex again.

Happy birthday to you too.

Don't you start dancing, dance with me.

In Greek they say that heaven is on earth and that hell is in the sea.

Heaven is in the sky; hell is on earth.

Do you realize what you've done?<br/>
What I've done is damn dangerous.

Hell is not far from here.<br/>
Dangerous what?<br/>
Dangerous to my family and friends.

Prepare the way for the coming of the Lord.
