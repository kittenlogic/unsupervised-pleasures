Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I have the most fabulous idea for a downtown nightclub. I would have spectacular lighting that would never fail to thrill. I would have balconies that spanned the infinity, I would have arches that crisscrossed the nights in a dance floor. I would have ceiling fans that would blow in the wind and whirl in the air, and I would have machinery that would churn out performers that would never fail to thrill. I would have machinery that would melt away the walls of the nightclub in favor of me, me and my show. I would have machinery that would give shape to the night as I saw it, and I would have the means to shape it, to transform it, and I would have the means to leave the world as I knew it. All because one man was not comfortable with my being himself.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
