Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.<br/>
My lover will lead the way<br/>
Out of the car, she will follow<br/>
And I will follow<br/>
Somewhere between kissing and blowing kisses, hands on hips<br/>
Orgasm. Maybe a shout<br/>
Something sexier<br/>
And I will be<br/>
Queer.<br/>
In love. Satisfied. Complete.<br/>
Imperious. Sexy. Prickly.

What will we do?

Have you ever had sex with anyone who wasn't straight? Or with someone just because of their sexual preference?

I don't think so.

Have you ever had sex with anyone just because they had AIDS?

I don't think so.

Have you ever had sex with someone just because they smelled different from you?

I don't think so.

Have you ever had sex with anyone who wasn't straight? Or with someone just because of their sexual preference?

I don't think so.

Have you ever had sex with someone just because they had a medical problem? Been hospitalized? Been on chemotherapy?

I don't think so.

I have always fooled around with people just because they looked different from me.

So I'd imagine.<br/>
And I will be<br/>
Seducing. Guilt. Betrayal. Abandonment.

I want more than that.

You do.

I want to be loved, cherished, and accepted for who I really am.

I am addicted to sex. I masturbate before sex and after. I don't get horny until after the sex.

You're being ridiculous.

It doesn't matter what we have.

I don't know.

No, it really doesn't matter.

All I know is that I want more than that. And I will be there to give it to you.

I have always had a wicked sense of humor.
