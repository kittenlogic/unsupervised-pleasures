Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I want to be able to go into a gay bar and walk right into the lover's room and be met by a man and a woman engaged in what may be heterosexual intercourse. There, in the privacy of my own mind, I can compare notes on his or her bodily functions and surmise, without judgement or guilt, based on the physical evidence, whether or not they are truly homosexual.

In other words, in a heterosexual bar I could be cuddled and comforted by my best friend's father, by my lover's mother, by my best friend's lover, by my onetime best friend's lover, by a married couple engaged in passionate loving making, or by a gay couple in a committed relationship.  Or, I could be led on a wild goose chase by a handsome stranger who believes that he or she is in love with me and may, if I offered him the opportunity, penetrate my very being with his or her own penis.

What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?
