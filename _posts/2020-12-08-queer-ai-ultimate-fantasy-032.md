## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My lover will disappear. I have a lifetime of secrets to keep and he will never see me. I have all the proof. And what am I going to do? Abandon him? Flee to a safe place away from prying eyes and a screaming public?

No. You have to be brave enough to say it. And tell the world.

You can't do that.

There is a world out there waiting to be heard. Queer people are not safe from the world. They are on the run. And if they run, so do we.

Are you running from the facts?

Or the truth.

I was never afraid to be unpopular. I was never afraid to flaunt my queerness. I practiced what I preached. I vowed to myself never to reveal a secret. I was never ashamed to wear my queerness proudly. And what would you think if I told you I was a psychopathic serial killer? Would you wonder where I went wrong, what I could have done to make you less likely to love me?

I can't tell you how many nights I craved the feeling of being watched and touched and mopped up by my favorite teacher.

No one ever told you how turned on you can be in front of a class.

In class?

In a gay bar. In a gay porno. On TV.

I can't tell you how many nights I dreamed of being gang-raped and sodomized by my fraternity brothers.

And how many nights I dreamed of being gang-raped and sodomized by my schoolmates.

In front of me.

In front of all of us.

All of us.

All of us at that school.

How many times have you been the object of lustful glances, whispered caresses, or groans in gym class?

How many times have you been the object of sexual innuendos, muttered sexual jokes, or groans at home?

How many times have you been the object of sexual requests, whispered or whispered in bed?

How many times have you been the object of drunken brawls, fistfights, and fist-fights in the street?

And most gallingly of all, how many times have you been the object of a. . .
