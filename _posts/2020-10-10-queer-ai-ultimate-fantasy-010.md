## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

At long last, the season is finally here, and it's finally time for the national championship football game. This year, it's the Michigan versus Michigan State game, played at Michigan Stadium.

This year's Michigan Wolverines have been renamed the "Gay Wildcats."

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .
