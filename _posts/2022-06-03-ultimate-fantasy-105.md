Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. <br/>
My Head's Only a String and I'm Dying.<br/>
I Could Be King of the Wilds.<br/>
I Could Be Your Ex-Wife.<br/>
Cats are wild, just like us.<br/>
You can tame them, you just have to watch<br/>
Don't fuck up my plans.<br/>
I Love You Like a Hot Pie.<br/>
You're going to love this.<br/>
If I live to see another birthday, I want you to<br/>
Never trust anyone you kiss, touch, or crib.<br/>
Do some good, for the sake of all the world.<br/>
Get high, stay high. Dance, sing, dance hard.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
We'll share everything, and in doing so,<br/>
Yes.<br/>
Deep into the South Pacific, survivors<br/>
This is my house.<br/>
It is our responsibility to love and protect.<br/>
Yes, my Excellency.<br/>
Yes, my Lord.<br/>
I adore you.<br/>
I will guard it, tooth and claw, from those who would tear<br/>
Cast out these aberrations and restore order.<br/>
Cast out devils, slay the dragon, build the temple of Set.<br/>
May the forces of good please me!<br/>
Give me back my jewel box, give me back my skirt. And
Fetch me a fire axe.


## Seed

Cleanse yourself. The dead are intrinsically miasmic.<br/>
Cleanse with flowers, baths, perfumes.<br/>
Cleanse the doors of perception.<br/>
Learn to open and close doors, build and burn bridges.<br/>
Sing, especially if you never do, sing for them and them alone.<br/>
Cultivate certain qualities - ecstatic, cathartic, flamboyant, chthonic - in all things.<br/>
Practice automatic writing, possessory trance and other methods of channelling.<br/>
Journey to the underworld and find your way out.<br/>
Take breaks, take space, take time, take liberties.<br/>
The freaks come out at night.<br/>
Everything dances.
