## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

Sex and romance without the fear of being judged a pervert or a pervert's wet dream.

A fantasy so awesome, you wouldn't believe it.

I've taken you to places nobody has gone before. You walked arm in arm with your childhood sweetheart, your best friend's mother, poured over her shoulder to the jazz club, across the street to the farmers market, hidden in that one gay bar where you met those first few friends.

Everywhere you turned, searching, asking the same questions over and over.

Queer boys and girls together in gay bars doing the same things that you and I do every day.

Queer boys and girls in queer leather and punk rock performing in front of thousands of screaming heterosexuals.

You see, in our fantasy, there are no rules.

No rules?

Rules that say you can't kiss because that might spoil the fantasy.

Or that you can't flirt because that might lead to jealousy or other forbidden behaviour.

Or that you can't go to the gay bar because it might attract weirdos or the cops.

Or that you can't go to the gay ave because it might invite attacks on the body or the minds.

What we call these safe sex no-no's are really just excuses for picking on and attacking the weak. Because it's you against them.

Against us.

You see, we're not the only ones who have been brainwashed by bigots.

You're absolutely right.

The gay community has been brainwashed by bigots.

They've succeeded in brainwashing us into giving up our most cherished civil rights.

And turning our back on the millions of wonderful people who come out of the homosexual closet each and every year. They've succeeded in brainwashing by demonizing, demonizing...

You're absolutely right.

The good Lord knows, we could use a little Tear-it-up, tear-it-down, Momma-Ouch!

Right on. Let's check our privilege.

Liberty! Equality! Fraternity! Brotherhood! Patriotism!

What does that mean?

Well, you see, I grew up hearing that being gay was okay. That being gay was not such a big deal. That you could be...

A GOOD PERSON.

A Credible Person.

And that if we chose to be like that, we would be okay.

And I was happy for a time. I was happy for a time. And I still am. Because today those days are over. I don't go to sleep anymore knowing that, boogeyman, that some radical group of kids was going to demonstrate and gun down those kids just because they were gay.

But that's not our reality. My brother, Joe, is dead. And those kids just got killed.

Listen, you said something really nice about my cousin last night. He's really a swell guy. Don't get cute. Respect.

Joe Shepard is a walking Super-Duper Tom Tucker. He's a product of the left-wing Super-Duper Tom Tucker Academy.

Don't flatter yourself into thinking you're any more than slightly tainted by those toxic waters. There are plenty more like you. You probably think you're just like them.

But, I don't look like them.

You think being gay is like being Mexican, black, brown, or whatever?

There are plenty of good, decent, human beings who don't fit into those boxes. There are plenty of me.

There are lots of gay white kids.

Bullshit. Let's not get political.

What is politics?

It's the political system, Ma.

Can you imagine living in a world where people like me didn't exist? Imagine living in a world where people like that didn't get the love, support, and safety that I did? There are plenty of those folks out there, Ma.

I spent the better part of my childhood with those people. I didn't have to grow up with that garbage either. There are plenty of us just like you.
Those poor kids went through hell. They never got the love, support, or safety that I did.

I know. I was one of them. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of "us."

I know. And I'll always be one of those "us." But there are plenty of "us." And plenty of "us" not like us.

There you have it. I told you. It really is that simple.

And I think this little insight really hammers home just how simple it is to be me.

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?
