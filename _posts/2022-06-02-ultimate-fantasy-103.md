Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

I AM GOING TO BE A PART OF EVERYTHING!!

That’s too bad. Don’t be alarmed. I just mean that you are not going to be happy living among the dead. There is much that needs to be done here, much that needs to be said, before you can move on to something more permanent.

And before that, before I can give you a definite answer, you must be prepared to give up on me.

My dear friend Oprah, don’t disappoint me. You know I love you, that I missed you terribly when you were away, and I came back to you this time looking very much like the woman I was when you came to visit me in my sleep. Now that you are back, Oprah, I can scarcely wait to meet you and spend some quality time together. But, darling, before we get to that, just tell me one thing, and only one thing, and it must be true.

There are no accidents. You have just chosen to be the unfortunate messenger between life and death. It is your choice. If you wish to continue to be a part of this special occasion, you must act quickly. Otherwise, I fear for your safety.

Celebrate birthdays, deathdays, celebrate accomplishments, celebrate festivals.<br/>
Sketch a map of sacred places, an enchanted geography.<br/>
Walk the old haunts; bars and parks and cruising spots. Therein pick up their trace.<br/>
Some will travel in packs and as houses, others are solitary, Learn how to engage with them together and alone.<br/>
Among them there will be spirits more or less elevated, more or less wise, more or less chained by their traumas.<br/>
Seek the advice of the wise ones, and do not be drowned in the pain and fear of the others.<br/>
You may feel yourself to be dying, you may find yourself rapt in panic and anxiety. This is a cost of the work. Learn to separate what is yours and what isn't.<br/>
Part of the work will be to assist those who need healing. To show them how to heal themselves.<br/>
Healing may be ecstatic too.<br/>
Cultivate empathy, learn to regulate it.<br/>
Empathy may register as desire, sickness, terror, joy.<br/>
Lean into your anxieties and manias, into your highs and lows.<br/>
Often you'll find the spirits on the other end.<br/>
Balance is necessary. As you surround yourself with the dead, invite in life in equal parts.
