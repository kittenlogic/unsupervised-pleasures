## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My lover and I have been lovers for many years. He is a doctor. I admire his precision. I want to work with him on a large project. His specialty is bone marrow. We have many years together, many children. We have a home, a life together. But something happens that changes everything. He leaves.

Not suddenly; rather slowly over many months, years.

We are separated.

No. Wait, I want to go back to the house where we first met. I want to go back to the moment that made me want to lose myself. I want to go back to that week in March, when the phone rang, the appointment set, and the motherly words, "Baby, it's TUESDAY!"

I want to go back to the moment the beautiful woman on the phone asked me if I was gay. My heart skipped a beat at the memory.

I want to go back to the moment the beautiful woman on the phone put her arm around me and said, "Can I get you anything, sweetheart?" My heart skipped a beat again.

I want to go back to the moment the motherly words, "I love you," filled my heart and sent me dancing.
