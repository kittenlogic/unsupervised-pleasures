Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

As I turn my back to walk across the platform. And suddenly a figure in the mist appears before me. It is... A WOMAN!! Her face is torn and bloody. She has large blotches of blood all over her body. She is covered in what appears to be pubic hair. She is covered in what appears to be a church. Her breasts have also been ripped off. She has a large gnarled tree growing out of her back.

I recognize this figure! She has a singular red poof on her forehead, which turns into a round white head as it drips out several red droplets. In this final projection, the fog has lifted, revealing that this is the loveliest woman on earth!! And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the figure turns and vanishes into thin air.

In this chapter, I share a number of stories from my experiences of becoming-queer, of methodological anarchism. these stories are not true, for I am in agreement with the notion that there is ‘no such thing as a true story’. Nor do they follow a single line of direction or desire; they connect to each other in many ways. they form a rhizome. In sharing these stories, I do not have a simple message or a particular argument to convey. Like Ursula Le Guin, ‘I wish, instead of looking for a message when we read a story, we could think, “Here’s a door opening on a new world: what will I find there?”’
