Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

This is for real.

I want you to imagine how I would feel if you were a man and I were a woman. Imagine kissing, holding hands, doing intimate body poses. How would we feel? How could we love? How could we live our lives? What would our fantasies be like?

I'd love to have you follow me home from the store and spend the night like we used to. We'd take turns kneeling in the dark, covering each other with our arms.

What if I turned hostile and said, "I don't want to see you anymore" and you had to fight me? What would our fantasies be like?

I'd love to see you walk down the street alone at night, your breasts swaying as you pass men on the street. I'd love to see the look in your eye as you turned and flashed that "I do".

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?
