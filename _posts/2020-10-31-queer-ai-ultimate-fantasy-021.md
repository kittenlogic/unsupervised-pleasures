## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, I was in the process of becoming a nurse. When I finished high school, I had the advanced training to become a doctor. I wanted to do both. I wanted to love patients and be doctors. So I was the ideal match for the Kinsey Reports.

What would you do?

What?

Would you sleep with every man?

You mean, would you sleep with all the hunky high school guys? Or would you settle for the studious junior high school teacher? Or the reserved professor? Or the outgoing nurse?
It would depend on how the relationship went. Would you want to keep me or give me away?

Is that like saying I'm gay or straight?

I've never been straight. And I have never been gay.

Since when do you say that?

Since I read your book.

My book is called Why We Marry.

How'd you know I read your book?

I put the book down several times and when I finally picked it up, it was with a big smile on my lips and a big "I See You" in my voice. I don't know why.

Because you were the only gay person I knew who had read your book.

That's right. And who read it.

We all have secrets. Not just about ourselves. We lie all the time. About our lovers, our friends. About the things we're embarrassed about.

Guilty again.

Believe me, there is one place in the McKinney Bookstore where you can buy my entire Kinsey Reports collection.

Please. Let's get back to the motel room.

One thing you may not know about my life is that I was very straight from the start.

From the time that you were born. So what you are saying is that I was born gay?

From the time that you started having sex.

That's not true.

From the time that you stopped having sex.

That's not true either. From the time you stopped telling anyone.

From the time that you realized you were gay.

Not the two things that you are. But the first thing that came to mind when I thought of you was.

But not the gay thing.

The homosexual thing. That's no longer an option.

It is. It has become an imperative.

But what's the alternative?

You're on birth control.

I've always been on birth control.

Why tell me that? I never had sex after I got married. I continued to have sex when I was sober.

You never had sex before you married.

Well, not until after we had two kids, of course. But I was on birth control from the moment that Janet and I bought that first yellow taxi into the Dallas motel room.

When did you first realize you were gay?

I had sex about three years earlier, with a woman named Loraine.

That's a lie. Loraine never had sex with me.

At the time that I thought of you, that is. Before that. And I think it was two years before I even knew that Janet and I were together.

I have a harder time accepting that than you do.

I think that's ridiculous. A young couple who were together for a year, having sex, and then divorcing nine months later.

It was a complete fluke.

Well, it was a natural outgrowth of a lot of things that were going on in our life. Like the alliances we had, the fights, the crying, the living together when we finally decided that we didn't want kids, that we didn't want to wait around for somebody to get pregnant before we made our move. All of it, in and of itself, was a perfectly reasonable thing to make happen.

But you don't seem to consider that it could have been handled so many years earlier.

I think you'd be surprised at how little people have changed.

I'd be lying if I said that the years between our first kiss and our last act of nonmarital intercourse were any less fulfilling than the two years I spent married to you.

It's just that the floodgates opened a bit earlier.

Well, that's true. There was a time, in fact, when the prospect of childbearing was unthinkable.

How so?

Well, the contraceptive revolution. That's the first thing that comes to mind.

Well, I can't help but think that perhaps you and I would have had different ideas of what childbearing was all about.

No. We adhered to the same old script that every couple does, and we juiced it up to 11.

And what about our sex life? You have such good taste.

Our sex life was fine. It was, in fact, one of the most fulfilling aspects of our relationship. You see, when I said that I enjoyed having kids, I wasn't lying. After I had a little go on my own, and after we made a few visits to the little boys's room at Randy's place, things really took off. When we decided to start having kids, we knew exactly what we wanted: a nice, quiet little boy, with a happy childhood, and a lot of sex. We were not looking for a Y.

A boy with a short fuse. Ring me.

I'm talking about a bonafide dutiful daughter.

Bonafide?

Don't get me started. I'd say bonafide.

So what's a bonafide daughter.

One thing. A daughter.

Exactly. One thing. What's a bonafide, exactly?

A bonafide nondirective, I guess.

Like a stay-at-home mother?

That's what I'd call it. A mother who's willing to take the kid on the road for the first time, or a stay-at-home father who's willing to take the kid on the road for the first time.
