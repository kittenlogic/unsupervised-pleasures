## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.

When I was in high school, I was in the process of becoming a nurse. When I finished high school, I had the advanced training to become a doctor. I wanted to do both. I wanted to love patients and be doctors. So I was the ideal match for the Kinsey Reports.

What would you do?

What?

Would you sleep with every man? I mean, would you sleep with all the hunky high school guys? Or would you settle for the studious junior high school teacher? Or the reserved professor? Or the outgoing nurse?

It would depend on how the relationship went.

Would you want to keep me or give me away?

Is that like saying I'm gay or straight?

I've never been straight. And I have never been gay.

Since when do you say that?

Since I read your book.

My book is called Why We Marry.

I put the book down several times and when I finally picked it up, it was with a big smile on my lips and a big "I See You" in my voice. I don't know why.

Because you were the only gay person I knew who had read my book.

That's right. And who read it.

We all have secrets. Not just about ourselves. We lie all the time. About our lovers, our friends. About the things we're embarrassed about.

Guilty again.

Believe me, there is one place in the McKinney Bookstore where you can buy my entire Kinsey Reports collection.

This evening has all the trappings of a slumber party.

Please. Let's get back to the motel room.
