## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My personal fable. It goes something like this.

I'll have my eager young protégé pitching himself in front of me on a silver platter. Prior and I have been lovers forever, and none of us will know except that we got there together and fucked.

Listen, lady friend. Your story doesn't stack up.

Oh I get it I get it! My story's so compelling it makes non-fiction look like history. It's my story and nobody else's!

Well, Ma, we all heard that story about how Doris Day somehow tricked Martin Luther King into coming out of the closet. And how that story stuck with Dr. King till his death. All those years of waiting for that one black boy to come outta the closet and into the mainstream. Remember the kid at the candlestick?

Martin's story stuck with Dr. King till his death. Not everyone was so lucky.

Woody Allen once said something that stuck with me. Whatever happened to innocence? At least in Hollywood it's all going for the taking.

Exactly.

Have you ever had that epiphany after a particularly tiresome movie or television spot? All your favorite gags and story lines are mashed up in your head and used as a crutch to keep you up watching television all night.

Nah.

Maybe that's how I was brought up.


## Seed

Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .
