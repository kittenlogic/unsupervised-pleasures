## Computer Generated

Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My personal fable. It goes something like this.

"Roy, why don't you take Heather out to dinner somewhere, and maybe we can have lunch together in private. You don't mind if I do this, right?"

And I thought it couldn't be more true.

After all, it's only been three months. All Heather has to do is walk through the door at Bluefish Cove and he'll be on my high horse forever. I'll have my eager young protégé pitching himself in front of me on a silver platter. Prior and I will have been lovers forever, and none of us will know except that we got there together and fucked.

Not to worry, darling: there's one minor detail that I'm sure you'll understand. Whenever Heather brings up the subject of her ex-boyfriend at dinner, he invariably brings up how he dumped her after three months of being together. The only way his story can make any sense, he'll say, is because she told him so.

Listen, ladyfriend. He didn't come crashing down with that one. I'm sitting here waiting for my high horse to come out and come

The only person he ever brought up after that is with me. My story doesn't stack up.

Oh I get it I get it! My story's so compelling it makes non-fiction look like history. It's my story and nobody else's!

Well, Ma, we all heard that story about how Doris Day somehow tricked Martin Luther King into coming out of the closet. And how that story stuck with Dr. King till his death. All those years of waiting for that one black boy to come outta the closet and into the mainstream. Remember the kid at the candlestick?

Martin's story stuck with Dr. King till his death.

Not everyone was so lucky.

Woody Allen once said something that stuck with me.

Whatever happened to innocence? At least in Hollywood it's all going for the taking.

Exactly.

Have you ever had that epiphany after a particularly tiresome movie or television spot? All your favorite gags and story lines are mashed up in your head and used as a crutch to keep you up watching television all night.

Nah. Maybe that's how I was brought up.
