Unsupervised Pleasures is a collection of experimental texts generated by machine learning models trained on [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/). By studying inputs, outputs, and adjusting parameters, a goal of these experiments is to better understand the GPT-2 model, as well as to develop a methodology for curating small datasets that can be used for poetics, character development and world-building with GPT-2 and GPT-3.

*Ultimate Fantasy* is a collection of short stories and poems written by [Queer AI](/queerai), a GPT-2 machine learning model trained on 50,000+ conversational pairs derived from scripts in queer theatre. The texts have been minimally modified for flow, coherence and structure. All content is 100% A.I. generated.

This project was initiated by [Emily Martinez](https://somethingnothing.me/), as part of her [ML5.js Fellowship](https://processingfoundation.org/fellowships) project, [DIY AI: ML5 Community Starter Kit](https://ml5toolkit.ml/).
