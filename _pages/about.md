Unsupervised Pleasures is a collection of experiments and texts generated by machine learning models trained on GPT-2.

The purpose of this site is for aggregating raw output and exploring ways of developing a methodology for curating datasets and testing output that can be used for character development and world-building with GPT-2.

[Queer AI](/queerai), the corpus used to generate the _Ultimate Fantasy_ series, is made up of 50,000+ conversational pairs derived from scripts in queer theatre.

This project was initiated by [Emily Martinez](https://somethingnothing.me/), as part of her [ML5.js Fellowship](https://processingfoundation.org/fellowships) project, [DIY AI: ML5 Community Starter Kit](https://ml5toolkit.ml/).
