Experiments with machine learning models for text-generation using charRNN and GPT-2.

This project was initiated by [Emily Martinez](https://somethingnothing.me/), as part of her ML5.js Fellowship project, [DIY AI: ML5 Community Starter Kit](https://ml5toolkit.ml/).

Emily is one of four [ML5.js Fellows](https://processingfoundation.org/fellowships) for 2020, a partnership between Processing Foundation and NYUâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program that specifically focuses on [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/).
