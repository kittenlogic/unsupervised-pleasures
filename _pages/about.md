## Who is this by/for?

We are artists interested in working with texts and AI using our own archives and ‚Äúsmall data‚Äù. We want to explore ways of practicing care and support through our technological ecosystems. We want to deepen how we bring queer, feminist, and decolonial methodologies into our everyday lives and work. We want to experiment with glitch, error, and infecting the larger AI systems with a plurality of stories as a strategy of resistance. We are curious to learn if/how these approaches can help us find openings, write new narratives, and create spaces that can hold us in ways that these systems were not designed to.

## Our Goals

- Making AI more accessible and pleasurable for beginners in a supportive environment.
- Centering historically excluded and misrepresented people and knowledge, respectfully and consensually.
- Developing deeper practice with queer, feminist, and decolonial methodologies.
- Working primarily with language models 
- Working with "no code" tools that lower barrier to entry and allow to prototype and test ideas with ease
- Setting up guidelines for preparing datasets that respect the contributors and protect their data sources.
- Creating _Love Corpora_, a collection of datasources featuring texts that orient towards life and liberation; made with community input and contributor consent.
- Finetuning Large Language Models (BLOOM, GPT-J, others) with our custom datasets
- Making machine learning models from "scratch" trained with our custom datasets
- Releasing bots trained on our models.
- Creating art, zines and art publications.
- Making a publicly available datasource library from _Love Corpora_.
