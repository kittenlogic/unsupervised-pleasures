Unsupervised Pleasures is a collection of experiments and texts generated by machine learning models trained on GPT-2.

*Ultimate Fantasy* is a collection of short stories and poems written by [Queer AI](/queerai). The texts have been minimally modified for coherence and structure. All of the content is 100% A.I. generated.

This project was initiated by [Emily Martinez](https://somethingnothing.me/), as part of her [ML5.js Fellowship](https://processingfoundation.org/fellowships) project, [DIY AI: ML5 Community Starter Kit](https://ml5toolkit.ml/). By studying inputs, outputs, and adjusting parameters, the goal is to develop a methodology for curating datasets that can be used for character development and world-building with GPT-2.
