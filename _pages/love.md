      <h1 class="mb-1 text-center gay">Tired of Bias in AI? Let's Make Love Corpora!</h1>

      <p class="mb-1 text-justify"><span class="lead"><em>Love Corpora</em> will be a collection of datasources featuring texts that orient towards life and liberation.</span> It will include, but not be limited to works that center decolonial perspectives, queer love, an ethics of care, and practices of commoning and mutual aid. We will create this collection with community input and contributor consent. We also plan to turn this into a publicly available library with full transparency about its contents, licensing terms, and collection methodologies.</p>

      <p class="mb-1 text-justify"><span class="lead">Love Corpora is inspired by:</span></p>

      <ul class="ul-circle">
        <li>A longing to collaborate more with people interested in working with AI, storytelling, and their own cultural archives.</li>
        <li>The crisis of imagination that literally underlies the machine learning models that big tech companies spend millions of dollars to make without the input or consent of the people they might be harming along the way.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-1 text-center gay">Who benefits?</h2>

      <p class="mb-1 text-justify"><span class="lead">Artists, storytellers, educators, writers, and other curious humans will enjoy:</span></p>
      <ul class="ul-circle">
      <li>accessible documentation, tools, and methodologies that can serve anyone with a desire to work with "small data" and their own cultural archives.</li>
      <li>a respectful process for doing this work that can be replicated or adapted to meet the particular needs of diverse communities.</li>
      <li>DIY publications, zines, bots, and whatever else we make together.</li>
      <li><a href="/about">Much more!</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-1 text-center gay">How do we create a respectful Love Corpora?</h2>

      <p class="mb-1 text-justify"><span class="lead">The dream is to explore the possibilities of creating new knowledge‚Äìrelationships using AI, with and by a plurality of voices.</span> This will be a very slow process, with working groups and careful deliberation over the decisions we make along the way.</p>

      <p class="mb-1 text-justify">This is not an attempt to create a monolithic collection. We do not wish to appropriate texts from bodies of cultures. Nor do we wish to extract knowledge that should be protected from machine learning algorithms or further exploitation. The integrity of this project is dependent on the level of humility, responsibility, and consent taken to see it through.</p>

      <p>Building trust with and uplifting others already doing this important work is foundational.

      <p class="mb-1 text-justify">Much care will be given to the processes of working in open collaborations that are inclusive, transparent and accountable to the bodies of knowledge and people we are in community with or wish to serve.</p>
