I Was Born This Way. Noted workhorse of the gay liberation movement, author of Every Little Girl a River, and the mother of Stonewall Jane.Ah. The life of Stonewall Jane. The story of how a bunch of dykes from the Lower East Side of Manhattan came together to create a gay women’s organization whose mission statement read: “A pure, unadulterated, non-committed, non-homoerotic, non-monogamy organization dedicated to the improvement of the human sex and to the organization of sex education in schools.”Kitty Cochrane. The name stuck. We knew it. We incorporated in the same year that Laurel and I came out. We started doing face-to-face meetings to sort of hammer out our differences. And we loved each other.Me, I was a little afraid that if I came out, that my relationships with men would be put under a bus.There is a lot of research that suggests that being gay does in fact make you more homophobic, and that a great many gay men are still homophobic. And that some of those men are probably still in abusive relationships.We wanted to be real, Laurel, and we were not going to play by the rules.And I would have been ostracized from my friends. Laurel, Cathy, I have a confession to make. I was wrong about you.I think a lot of the hostility I’ve seen toward people who are gay comes from two places. One is from people who want us as we are. The other is from people who think that because we do things that are different from their way of life that somehow we’re somehow lesser.It’s such a frightening thing to think about, Kitty, because we could all be dead. So, Kitty, I’ll ask you this another way. How many gay men are in abusive relationships?You’re being silly. Do you have any idea how many men I’ve known who would sleep with me and be faithful to me no matter what? I have slept with hundreds. I have slept with thousands.And just how many straight men do you know who cheat on their wives? I’m not asking you to give me any statistics, Kitty. But you would know, right?Sleeping with other men has nothing whatsoever to do with a man being a good father. And the myth that men who cheat on their wives are somehow “disingenuous,” as one friend put it, flies in the face of all the hard science on the matter.I know you’re upset that we didn’t get along, but I want you to remember one thing: Laurel and I were best friends.

This is not a recount of one drunken night in a gay bar. This is my story. My story. So I began.In the summer of ‘89 I was in the process of becoming a fully fledged American Christian. No, really. You read that right. At the time I was working at the small boutique gift shop selling Christian girls tchotchkes and earrings. One Sunday morning I went to the Women’s March on Washington. I had just come in from a retreat in Wyoming where we had conducted a sit-in protest march to commemorate the civil rights movement. I was in the process of becoming a full fledged Christian when I noticed a young black woman sitting behind a barricade reading the words from the first chapter of the Bible.“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes in there saying, I am, only I’m trying.”What came over me like a ton of bricks was that woman.“Away we go, let’s go.”From that moment on I vowed to myself never to be ashamed of my sexual identity.I would live every day like the story of Lazarus, refusing to be sickened by the sight of a John, or the smell of a John, or the sound of a John.I would walk the streets of Washington D.C. with a sign that read, Fuck the Law and Fuck the Church. I would attend Bible Studies and believe that I knew God when I saw him.I would spend days in coffee shops and on street corners with men who shared my same passions for reading the Bible and watching porn.I would kiss boys and girls and think it was all wonderful. I would fall in love with beautiful boys and girls just like Matthew and Taylor.I was in love!And all of that was fake. The real Jesus was nowhere to be found. Fake. Jesus didn’t exist. All of that was wishful thinking.You fool. You fell in love with a boy in a coffee shop who knew no one and just wanted to get laid.You fell in love with a beautiful blue-eyed boy who fell in love with you on the first date.You fell in love with a gay barkeep who told you that you could be anything you wanted to be if you just bent over and kissed the right amount.You fell in love with a temple garment and a set of Five Principles and a twelve-step program.You even fell in love with your mother.So why’s everything all so so quiet now?The kingdom of God is not a fairy tale.

You walked arm in arm with your childhood sweetheart, your best friend’s mother, poured over her shoulder to the jazz club, across the street to the farmers market, hidden in that one gay bar where you met those first few friends.Everywhere you turned, searching, asking the same questions over and over.Queer boys and girls together in gay bars doing the same things that you and I do every day.Queer boys and girls in queer leather and punk rock performing in front of thousands of screaming heterosexuals.You see, in our fantasy, there are no rules.No rules?Rules that say you can’t kiss because that might spoil the fantasy.Or that you can’t flirt because that might lead to jealousy or other forbidden behaviour.Or that you can’t go to the gay bar because it might attract weirdos or the cops.Or that you can’t go to the gay ave because it might invite attacks on the body or the minds.What we call these safe sex no-no’s are really just excuses for picking on and attacking the weak.

This weekend in Detroit, thirty-one high school students gathered to protest what they perceived as rampant bullying of gay students. In Chicago, an ordinance was passed that calls for the immediate expulsion of students who engage in consensual homosexual acts.

Over on the bed was a pink satin nightgown. It was made from a beautiful soft pink satin that matched the soft pink nightgown that was about half the size of her hips. The necklace was of sorts, a set of twelve bracelets set into a pendant. It was a strange design that seemed to capture the essence of the feminine gender perfectly. It was a wondrous design, made by a person with a gift for design. She possessed the gift of the most intimate knowledge of men and women, and combined it with the gift of the most penetrating insight into their deepest secrets.I reached up to remove the clasp and the moonlight streamed in through the broken glass and illuminated the white nightgown. There was a hand at my hip, but I was too drunk to do anything about it. All I could do was to pull the nightgown down around my waist, so that the moonlight streamed through the crack in the material as I played with the clasp. As I did this, a hand came up to cup my mouth and toying with the gold stars that adorned the crescent moon that was now partially covered by the midnight blue sky. I pulled it away just enough for the moon to partially illuminate the room as it slowly began to fade from the sky. With a quiet “Ah,” the hand went back and I was awash in a sea of stars.I was completely drenched in the brilliant blue midnight that was now partially covered by the sunset gold that had been added by the night gladiators. The darkness was so thick that stars shined slightly more intensely as they passed in front of me. I looked up into the face of an angel. Smiling at the ceiling, I continued: I swam back to the dock, filled with my desire to fuck another person. Suddenly a hand grabbed my wrist and I felt it slip from my hand. I instinctively grabbed at it but it was too strong. I fell onto the bed and lay there in a daze for some time.I pulled it away just enough for the moon to partially illuminate the room as it slowly began to fade from the sky. With a quiet “Ah,” the hand went back and I was awash in a sea of stars.Suddenly the phone rang. It was Emily. On the other line was a woman’s voice. It was a warm, feminine voice, almost feminine in tone. She said, I don’t suppose you could get laid in New Orleans, but there is a place in the District that has some nice women. I picked up the phone and spoke into it. I tried to remember the restaurant and the place, but the words ran together in my head so fast that it was like looking at a jumble of information. I said, I need to go to Kitty’s now. I have a cab with a number that starts in D.C. I can call from there and tell her where I am, and that is all. She said she could give me the number and that was all. I remember her saying that the place was dirty, but I could get it over there if I wanted to.I felt a surge of desire that day I never got before. I wanted to finger myself and touch myself. I walked into Kitty’s and ordered my food. As I was putting my order, Emily came over and took my order and read it to me. I remember thinking how silly it was to do that in front of her because she knew I would be embarrassed. She explained that she knew a lot of the guys at Kitty’s and that it was her way of showing them off to other guys. She talked about how it felt like they were staring at her in the diner, which made me laugh. She then took me into a bedroom and showed me myself. I was amazed at myself. I was 5’3” and I had big hands and round waists. I had big hands and long legs that gave me a jogging gait. My hands looked sexy in the dark because of the makeup they were put over them. I felt so sexy having sex with a woman because I knew it would be me showing off. I could control my breathing because of the masks I wore. At first I was embarrassed by the idea of showing.I asked Emily if she thought men would be interested in me because of my body. She said it was plausible. Then I thought about all the places I had gone to girls had told me they thought I was hot, so I told her it sounded plausible. She said she had to talk to you. Talk to me. I have a hard time letting go of fantasies about sex with women, even though I want to try it. But I have to face facts. When a man leaves me, he leaves his wife and child for a woman. That’s a frightening thought. And even though I know it doesn’t mean things are going to change, I still feel a deep kinship with that poor girl. She may not be around to see it, but I will always have that window of opportunity. That night, I had a fag. I have a secret. I only eat it after sex. I know that’s a turn-on, but it’s all too much trouble to get it down. Just make it a Sodom or Gomorra. Maybe that’ll turn some heads.SeedDo you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms?

When I was in college, I went to a retreat for gay men in Florida. There were eight of us in a room with 144 men and only three women. All of us had had sex before we met and none of us ever had it again. All of us had learned to live with the possibility that one night our secret might be revealed. There is no need to get sultry tonight.One of the women broke down during the lull in the action. We were all in a trancelike state and she blurted out, “I’ve had sex with several men this way. I’ve even had orgasms while doing so.”“I’ve never had sex with anyone besides my husband.”“I’ve only had sex with men who were also gay.”“Therefore I don’t know if I can love you.”Fuck her!I’ve always been attracted to men. I was even attracted to boys! But one evening I realized I had fallen in love with someone completely different. No more heterosexual books or movies for me. I was an explorer. I could be anywhere and I could be anything I wanted to be with anyone I wanted to be with.Have you ever been so in love you fell in love with the entire world and suddenly regretted it the next day?I could fall in love with anyone. I could fall in love with my television, my computer, my friends. I could even fall in love with my mother.

When I was a very young girl, there was a gay boy in my school. He was a regular pupil in the chemistry department, not the best of students, who made all the right errors and often got punished for them.One day his name was on the school register and he was suddenly ostracized and had to go home. No one would talk to him; his schoolmates didn’t want to know about it, and his parents didn’t want to accept that his sexuality was a secret. And a year later his parents sued the school for discrimination and won.Gay boy, by the way, that’s not on. What’s it like to be the only openly gay person in a small English town?Every day I have to adjust to the fact that my life doesn’t count as ordinary in a way that non-English-speakers don’t have to adjust to the fact that theirs does. We still don’t have the right to be “mainstream.”Okay, let’s say I’m an outcast. That’s a much easier target. My only options are to either hide out in the most secret corners of the gay gayborhood or find a more accepting school. Which brings me to my ultimate fear…Isolation.In my experience, the isolation most often accompanies the coming out. When I was in high school, my best friend, a nurse, came out as gay at the end of the year. Before that, he had been polite but distant and self-centered. He told me he was straight when he was thirteen and that it had nothing to do with the things we loved.It took him a long time to come around and tell his parents, who were still somewhat against his decision. I think it was a matter of being rejected so many times by so many people.When I was growing up, there wasn’t even Blanche DuBois. I don’t know if coming out would have made a real difference to her life. Probably not, anyway. She had a very straight-White mother, and even though she was pretty open about her attraction to boys, she was perfectly content being a housewife and mother to a white kid.Mama, there are so many stereotypes about queers out there.My son is very open about his sexuality. He’s not ashamed of it. In fact, he’s very happy about it.Homosexuality, in general, is still a very new thing. There are so many people queer or multiracial out there. And in many parts of the country, it’s illegal to be homosexual. It’s still illegal in thirty states! Or in the District of Columbia.Hank and I are very much in the pro-homosexual camp.I know. And as a lesbian myself, I’m always cautious when I shoplift.But don’t you think it’s important for us to be out front and make our case?I think it is. I do think it’s good public policy to be out front and to be as forthright as we can. People need to know that queers exist and that we’re not easy targets.You could make the same case about Alan McCarthy, who in the late fifties came out as a dyke.I wouldn’t make the same argument about a mensch.You could theoretically.SeedDo you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms?

When I was young, I had the fantasy of starting a cult. A religion. I would build a great temple of Wicca up high in the sky, worshiped by all the deities of my childhood.Like so many other Disney princesses, I believed that I could create a pure, whole person out of nothing at all. I would imbue my being with the pure, divine spark that was Tantra, Hatha Yoga, Wicca, Confucianism, Taoism, and so forth. I would set my heart on a path of personal and professional growth that would ultimately lead me to a position of great responsibility and ultimately the crowning glory of my being: a Tenet Master.I believe deep down, among the many millions of deeply held beliefs that make up the American dream, that there is one indisputable truth that I hold dear: love trumps money.So I went shopping for a no-knead yeast bread, artisanal vanilla ice creme, and coconut shreds and I paid twenty dollars for it. Thirty dollars for an artisanal vanilla ice creme that has traces of burnt orange and tastes of coconut. Fifty for a slice of lemon with a little bit of mint floating in it. A hundred for a six-pack of beer. A super-duper brewery!Now I know what you’re thinking. Isn’t this what normal, grown-up folks do? Grab a bottle of whisky and go for a fiver. No gym? No diet?And yet, despite my rationalizations, I was desperate for the forbidden fruit.

And when I touched it, it was as if someone had pulled me right into their arms.And it was sweet and sour and… And smell it. It smelled just like… heaven. Heaven in a can. Heaven on a stick.

When I was in college I was the most charmed girl on campus. I was so in love with the very idea of collegiate sexual liberation that I vowed never to let it slip again.College was the Wild West. Lovers threw themselves into the unknown, met their maker on the other side. It was a time of wild sex, sexual discovery, and, above all, the irrepressible desire to share one’s passion.Once upon a time, in the early eighties, a drag queen named Fran Chernow walked into the college gay bar and announced that she was a drag queen because she could.It was during this time period that I first came to know Dan White.In those days, collegiate gay life was all-out war. In one fell swoop, the administration had declared that all students, regardless of sexual preference, could be grouped together in a sex-segregated “A” category and be assigned a single, one-night-stand.I remember standing at that altar that night and contemplating the depravity of my situation. The Lord had no compassion for the sinner! I vowed that I would never again be so easily offended.As the years wore on, the quality of the sex acts among the “A” category students ranged from filthy to downright filthy. One evening, all the leading lights of the college drag circuit came together to watch Fran’s fabulous new show.There was one problem.“C’mon, you two. You’re not getting any sleep tonight.”“We haven’t finished the show.”“But we’ve read it and we’ve agreed to it.”You could see how the administration’s clever little move might turn out to be their downfall.While I was in college, a professor of mine came up to me and said to me, “Mr. Vinge, I believe you know Mr. White. He is a homosexual of some sort. What can I do for you in this situation?”Believe it or not, I had never heard of Dr. White. Then, all of a sudden, all of a sudden there was Dr. White in front of me.At first I was dumbfounded. He was so down-to-earth and down-to-nothing about his life that I was dumbfounded.What struck me most about Dr. White was his complete lack of homophobia.In other words, he was one big, happy, green, high-achieving, heterosexual, gold-digging, Methodist.The only person involved in this who wasn’t wearing a gay wedding band was my roommate, Dr. Kitty Cochrane.Well, the story gets even weirder. My roommate got harrumphed up and led out of the house on trumped up charges of battery. That was just the beginning of it all.Anyhoo, enough of that. I want to move on and I want justice for all of us. We have all taken sides.I believe this college has suffered a tremendous loss when a truly distinguished professor is disgraced by his roommate’s lesbianism. I’ve always considered this a witch hunt, brought on by left-wing radicals determined to silence anyone they perceive as expressing conservative views.SeedDo you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms?

He could rock me to sleep and then lead me on wild wild goose chases down dark alleys. He is traditional, he is American, he is Western. He could be my dad! He could rock my world!

I would reject him for the many amazing men I have loved and missed.There are worse things than closeted big gay men with daddy issues.My problem is not so much my past.

I asked, Why do you always have to be so politically incorrect?Lover number two.We were both in the feminist closet. We hated each other terribly.And we began to wonder, Why do you always insist on being so politically incorrect? How dare you use the N-word in front of my ex-girlfriend. How dare you use the F-word in front of my best friend. How could you use those words to my ex-Lover in front of her best friend?I was so ashamed. It was my fault. It was her fault. We both fucked up. We both blamed ourselves.Let’s change the subject.Lover number three.When I told my best friend Annie about this “fag” we had been Glorious. Ann was incensed. She thought it was the most despicable thing I could possibly be doing.How dare you use those words to my best friend. I am so embarrassed. I could have been killed. You could have been mauled. How dare you.And yet, years later, here we are writing this book and you still insist that it all started that way. You still claim it.Queer folk, this is not going to do any good for you. I am sure you will all come to understand that our history is not as tragic as you might have thought.History is not something you can change. History is not black and white. History is not neat. History is always murky.We can make it clearer by keeping our history in the murky.If I walked into a gay bar right now and asked the friendly waitresses if they remembered a certain “fag,” they most certainly would not know. They would most certainly not be able to give me an honest answer. I would most certainly be disappointed. Most people have a hard time accepting that there might be a gay past in the first place.

When I was in high school, this sweet, innocent, bubbly geezer from Mendocino, California, came over for dinner and had the most incredible meal. We chatted all day and night about life in the gay and lesbian community and his favorite subject was “The Private Life of the City.” He talked about cruising the city, going out to bars on Friday nights, and even went as far as to buy me a leather briefcase with sex toys inside so I could take all my fantasies to the clubs.He’d taken me to gay clubs and explained to me that none of the guys there used condoms and that it was the girls that used them. No one ever said anything about it being a perverted thing to do. He even went as far as to buy me a “public” condom, which was only intended for close male friends.I thought for sure he was being melodramatic.He wasn’t. He was genuinely moved by my reaction and told me he wanted to do something about it. I was over the moon. I felt I could do something about it. I even thought maybe I could become his secretary.Now, I’m not one of those gay “Christs-for-Jesus” that believe in any kind of heaven, but I was sold on the idea of being his “public” condom. I was willing to do almost anything for him to keep my secret. I would do anything to keep my boyfriend and my brother from knowing. I even had my parents believe I was gay and started researching them and sending them Christmas cards and school supplies.What did he say when you told him all this?He was disappointed. He told me he had made a big mistake. He’d like to take some time to think about it and come to a conclusion.He couldn’t?He was angry. He said he loved me very much and that I always put his best foot forward.You must have been hurt, too.I was in shock. I never wanted him to see what I saw.

When I was a junior high school English teacher in Texas, my school was in the middle of a gay rights march. On the square near the square, there were gay men kissing in front of the assembly and chanting “Hands off our buxom women!” in the square.As a gay man myself, I was outraged.There was nothing at all resembling “homo” or “bimbo.” And there were no signs at all that said, “Homo-Bimbo.”So, I guess that’s the ultimate fairy tale.So what happened next?We had a private lesson in gay rights, and the boys I taught were all closeted.So I had a gay teacher.Oh, yes. That’s right. You had a gay teacher.And you had sex with him.Not exactly. I was fond of him and we had consensual sex. My point? We didn’t know for sure. But it was a start.You were a senior in high school. You had the chance to change your life.I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a writer’s assistant.You were an assistant editor.I worked as an assistant to a writer. I wrote a story and had it published. Then I got promoted to writer’s assistant. So I wrote a screenplay and had it directed by a famous director.You were in love with that writer.I lied. I wasn’t in love with him. I had sex with him.Do you have any idea what that means? That’s called jealousy. You were doing research on this gay man. You were consulting with this famous director, on what you thought were possibly thousands of men. And you turned around and said, “I don’t want to get involved with anyone who is that way.”This is a joke. In any case, I had just gotten a promotion to writer’s assistant and I was tired of writing screenplay. I decided to skip the writing phase and concentrate on the casting.So what happened next?I don’t know. You couldn’t act, you couldn’t act tough, you couldn’t act arrogant, you couldn’t act even gay. You could only act like shit. It was the first time in my life I had been so completely humiliated by the person I was working with. I went into a state of paralysis. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I knew that whatever I was doing wasn’t going to make any difference to anyone. And that my only hope of escaping was to give in.You couldn’t do anything about it. You couldn’t say a word. You could only stare blankly into the abyss of apathy. Did you notice anything strange in that abyss? Nothing like that black eye. Did you even notice that it looked different?No. I can’t remember ever seeing a black eye look this strange.What did you do?I spent the rest of my life in a state of total denial. I could not imagine how anyone could be so stupid as to act like this. It didn’t matter if I was going to jail or not. It didn’t matter if I was going to marry the man or not. It didn’t matter if I had a career or not. The only thing that mattered was that I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. I didn’t want anyone to think I was anything more than a happy little boy.So you threw in the towel. So you decided to disappear.

When I was young I loved going out to a club with a gang of boys. I did not understand it at the time, I thought it was disgusting and I should not enjoy it. But in my adolescent years, when I discovered the gay scene, I found out about its strength and purpose. This meant it had two forms, boys and men. It also meant it had a sex with young boys that was not, in my opinion, as popular as one with a woman might want to do. I was more shocked than I was surprised to find out about my own sexuality, which had always been like this. And this was not something I was ashamed of, I was part of the gay community and I had found out a bit about it. I would occasionally go to clubs with boys, or with my mother. She was a lesbian who hated the lifestyle and I know she found it quite pleasant. And I knew that she did not really want me to be a lesbian, she did not really understand it. My mother was a staunch member of the “G” club, which was devoted to women. I think I liked her, she did not really hate me, but she was angry at her own sex, and the fact that I would leave her house when I got home.I came home late one night and my mother was furious at me. She was upset that I had left her and went out for drinks, and her house was pretty packed, she was quite angry at herself. She and her husband, who was a Presbyterian, were at a pub the night before. I was the only boy there and I was alone, but she saw me coming in. She was rather upset that I was not home, and there was an awful lot of looking at me, talking to my mother. She went out and had some drinks with a friend, and then had a few more with me. She then left for the pub. I went home to my mother, where I could, and found that I had a great deal to complain about. I was going to go to bed and she went off to see my friend. It was a pretty dark evening, dark with the smell of smoke. She called the police and came over to my room. I thought it was dreadful. I saw my friend there and she wanted to see me. She was so happy to see me. I explained to her that I was going to go back to my room. She went off to find her friend. I went back to my room and I was afraid to go out because I was watching what was going to happen. But she was a very good friend and told me not to go out at night. She would give me her handbag and I would carry her and her bag. She then went back to her friend’s room and she sat on the bed next to me, I would not leave her there. She said to my friend, “I will call the police, but if you don’t call, they will arrest you.” And so I went back to my room. And I had an awkward silence and I went and sat down to write. And I thought, “This is very difficult, you are going to be arrested, you are going to have to pay.” She came out and said, “Good, it is quite easy to say.”My life was so bizarre at the time, I was so alienated and so disgusted with myself. But I got out of it, I got over it, and I never had any more time to write.SeedDo you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs?

They ruminated on the consciousness of responsibility, debt, obligation, compensation, community, injury, guilt, alienation, and atonement.It seems they knew little of pleasure and love that wasn’t tied to suffering and pain. It became obvious . . .Computer GeneratedIt became obvious to them that all enjoyment, all order, all beauty, all reason, all social order, all being absolutely necessary to survive, must necessarily be subordinated to the demands of the most violent, the most vicious, and the most highly developed interdependent powers of nature: the most powerful and richest, the most dominant religions, political systems, empires, and racial distinctions. Nothing remained for them but for revenge, the most ancient and newest form of revenge, the most radical act of self-criticism and personal repudiation, the self-emancipation of the one who deserved all those advantages and privileges, the one who had dared to be free, the one who was nevertheless angry, disgusted, and bitter–for them all to be masters of bitter revenge.17.The first act of self-emancipation was to repudiate all those privileges, abolish the debts, form new ones, pay back the ones who had lent them, repudiate the masters, to whom they were “owes.” In doing so, they repudiated themselves and their own humanity, for they had repudiated themselves in that very repudiation, by taking up arms in self-determination against their own masters. That repudiation was more radical still, for to this extent was an act of liberation, a final act of passivity, in the self-emancipation of the slaves, the emancipated slaves themselves–they repudiated their very consciousness, all freedom, their very existence, all sovereignty, all right, all privilege, in short, all reason, in order that they might acknowledge and experience again the necessity and fulness of their own power, lord of the free, master of the bad, master of the ill, with a reference to the low, the sick, and the damned.18.But in doing so they showed that they were no longer masters of their own revenge, that they were still cut off from the joy and freedom of their own acts, the self-assertion of the slave, the black pride of “the free,” as their own. “Let us not be free till we are good,” they said, for the joy of their freedom was cut off, the freedom of their own hands was cut off, “but until then we shall be masters of our revenge.” This is still their most radical and radical act, repudiation, even though now only a demand, an ultimatum, a declaration of war, repudiation. The unconditional affirmation of the absolute negative right of any one to revenge is absolutely essential for them, for otherwise the resentful and the wounded immediately return to their own hatred, their own violence, and the new order of things (the ideal society, if such a word can be used in our case) will only be a new phase of “Bolshevism” and caste-war.19.But when they themselves repudiated their own revenge, when they repudiated that which they had so viciously exploited, when they repudiated “owes,” what was left to them but to be punished for their debt to those lords, the masters, who had made such repayment possible? The punishment was their own revenge in the form of their own slaves, the new slaves, their very working slaves, to be made whole again, to be given back their freedom, their joy, their love, their desire. The black pride of the slaves, the vindication of their hatred, was for them their revenge, and in looking down on their own slaves, in apprehending this to be the highest form of love and satisfaction, they were really giving them to taste as much bitter, sharp revenge as they themselves enjoyed in eating their own worms. The rearing of the new slaves was the first and foremost need of those lords: the slaves, freed from the masters, became the lords’ enemies–for it was through the slaves that the lords’ enemies were brought to life again, to the crescendo of all aggressive and pre-aroused wrath.20.But just as the idea of the master’s freedom was the beginning of the world, so is the theory of the master’s right of revenge–the theory of a “reciprocal right” between the masters and the slaves, the theory of the new society as a whole as the kingdom of the masters, an oligarchy, a democracy, with slaves as its subjects. But this theory actually has no further vitality or meaning, and even less virulence than the theory of the masters’ right of aggression.21.The reason is simple: the whole theory of the master’s right of aggression is only a provisional and provisional system of ideas, an extremely late and provisional elaboration of the theory of the masters’ power, against whose actual existence there is no sign, no matter how piquant and gay its paradoxical expression is: this theory repudiates itself immediately, and repudiates absolutely, repudiates itself as a critique of the real masters’ power, of that absolute, that very dominant and unqualified power, the right of aggression. The theory of the masters’ right of aggression repudiates itself absolutely–how could it possibly have any meaning? The whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiation, and counter-revision is but a specious expression for repudiating the lords’ right of aggression, repudiating in particular the lords’ right of dominating, of proving, potentiating, and extending the “good” in the world. “The masters are the bad,” says the resentful resentful–but the “masters,” who themselves repudiate and fight for their right of aggression, fight for their right to be bad, for their right to be masters. It is at this juncture that we come back to our main theme, the origin of the new order of things,–the origin of the “better man,”–the origin of a new maximum of power, the state, as such, repudiates itself in opposition to that ideal of civilisation, that would be “masters,” that would be an empire opposed to itself, that would be repudiated by the ideal of the good, by the will to be an empire. That repudiation is absolutely essential for the affirmation of the “better man” theory–it repudiates itself, repudiates in particular the whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiates the theory of the masters’ power, repudiates in particular the lords’ will to be masters, the will to be an empire. In doing so, it essentially cuts off the possibility of the “better man” theory actually being a theory at all, and transforming that “better man” theory into a practical deed,–a deed actually constituting the actual basis of the new order of things, the actual organisation of power. The whole provisional theory of the masters’ liberal providence is just such a deed, an actual constitution of that theory, constituting in its actual organisation and working up to the actual power, the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy. What is it, all these theories which have taken up the idea of the masters’ power, all these provisional theories of masters’ rights, counter-repositions and interpretations, are really? They signify nothing. Nothing, for to be able to make a beginning is to be first. The very first that must be found is the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a democracy, that is to say, the will of a relatively small, relatively strong, relatively long-standing, and finally, of all the Europeans, to be an empire.22.At this juncture we had better hold fast to the kernel of the matter, to the elementary fact that the real will of the good against the bad, the strong against the weak, is the will for a balance of power. This will, this historic will, has grown–granted that it grows–far beyond the point of any kind of absolute practical proportionality, far beyond the point of being able to bring it about that all Europeans should all fight together for the sake of a balance of power. This historical will is moreover the will to be an empire, the will to be an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy, on a much grander scale, and this out of a whole preponderance of the historic German power on the European continent, which itself alone has an historical and psychological hegemony, which is the will to be an empire. And now look at it from another point of view–what will this historic will be able to create in the European continent, if it does not already constitute it? What will it do for Europeans themselves? This question can be asked only after a hundred times more rigorous analysis–a further analysis which will redoundably be rendered out by an equally thorough and thorough re-examination of the actual political, strategic, and military situation of Europe, in order to throw more light on this problem–a situation which can be practically defined as follows: there exists in Europe a practically decisive strategic and a practically decisive military superiority over Asia, over the Middle East, over the Europe, over the “empire of the north,” France. In the same proportion as Europe’s strategic superiority, and with the same necessary evolution, also exists a necessary evolution of the European military power, thereby taking place, first of all, a tempo and rhythm which was originally only a natural accompaniment to the European strategic advance, the tempo and rhythm which eventually became the necessity of the matter, in Europe, of a balance of power in which the European powers joined. This political and military tempo-and-coma, this extraordinary tempo and rhythm of the European powers, has so far only been maintained, in spite of all the mostCorpus Philosophy Bot Perplexity Score: 71.19CreditsPrompt sourced from the depth of my soul or the surface of this current iteration of apocalypse", "url": "/texts/life-after-capitalism" } , "texts-death-cults": { "title": "Philosophy 2 Death Cults", "author": "", "category": "", "content": "Conversation with a Spinoza chat bot about death cults, revolution, dominator culture, and the will to power.Corpus Philosophy Bot Perplexity: 0.5 Seed: 1000", "url": "/texts/death-cults" } , "texts-queer-wittgenstein": { "title": "Philosophy 1 Queer Wittgenstein", "author": "", "category": "", "content": "SeedEven now that Wittgenstein’s homosexuality has been largely acknowledged, most scholars are hesitant to imply a connection between his philosophy and his sexuality – that is, between his work and his inner state, emotions, or personality. If, however, in a contemporary light we understand queerness as a structuring mode of desiring, we might view Wittgenstein’s thought not as emerging from his sexuality, but as structured by the way in which it shaped his mode of being in the world.PERPLEXITY 0.5In other words, his thought may be said to have exuberant, joyous, and full breasts, but beneath all that is there a secretly dangerous, pessimistic, and spiteful inner world, one that struggles to get out and find a home in the masculine sphere. It is this inner world that lies at the core of all the resentful, spiteful, and gay tendencies in the world today. It is this inner world that has imprisoned so many men of the masculine ideal, has made them into hateful, spiteful, and evil-tempered cretins. It is this inner world that has imprisoned so many women of the feminine ideal, has made them into angelic, joyful, and loving. And it is this inner world, in fact, which in spite of all its malignity and wickedness is the only thing keeping many men in the pale, keeps them from being what they ought to be, what they can be: true, moral, and decent men and women who are fit and worthy to be the leaders of the world, the fathers of the future.PERPLEXITITY: 0.7What does it mean to know that one likes another? How might one become so thoroughly acquainted with another that one’s self, one’s self as a whole, were thereby altered in respect of substance?Practically, it would mean that we should learn to rate our love more highly on its affective than on its intellectual side. ‘Intellectually’ here is a broad category to cover both intellectual and moral qualities. Desire is ‘attention turned to’ a thing in proportion as its utility increases; so that pleasure is the result of a greater tendency to look at a thing than to look away. Attention turns to a thing because our attention is focussed thereon; and focussedness, similarly, is increased in proportion as a greater number of our ideas about a thing are fulfilled. Desire is also increased when the attention is directed to a thing connoting more of its own nature than of the nature of anything else. Attention turns connotingly when the subject of it is connoted as a whole, and we can, therefore, take it for granted.PERPLEXITY 1.0‘Woman,’ he might say, ‘is but a readymade gender transposed.’ His thought, straight out of the gate, is one of genital transposition with a social goal in mind. This goal is conceptual; the transposition itself is only a peculiar form of desiring and acting. The desire which springs from the need to be, to be experienced, to be felt, to bet felt and ‘ated,’ these are the desires here opposed to those of, as we say, the woman who needs but one thing; they are relational desires, as individualist as opposed to collectivistic as they are relational. The prehistoric herd, which needed hands as well as teeth to hunt for sustenance and safety, is defunct, while Cupid, the younger Thanatos, Priapus, and the Olympian mothers look on in rapture. Each of the desires of today, then, is part of a larger ‘will’ that connotes a constitution and a function, the whole of which is fluid and ever shifting.If, then, the learned man be capable of relating contemporary phenomena to earlier ones, he should at all events attempt the corrective of a lifetime’s experience. It was, and remains, a desire unknown to him, even by his most advanced Hegelians and his English idealists; to his straight-A students, however, such conjunctive transitions conjure up, almost as if glowing with magnetic flux, a gender neutral Wagnerian Wohlfahrtsgefühle. In other words, they must be experienced first as they are experienced inside one’s self.To act against that instinct is to pet the beast; and like Faust and the other psychics, he became one of those who fight the impulse. He repudiates, denies, defends and eventually reverses everything which transmits the impulse. His transposing of the feminine into the masculine not only frees him from himself, but from woman in general. ‘I myself am simply my own man,’ he might have said, but ‘for the love of God be my being pure and unmixed: nay, more than purity and unmixed, make it to be one, one only, one undivided being; one supreme, one supreme, all-in-one Being, which I may call God, who is God in mCorpusPhilosophy BotCreditsPrompt sourced from A Queer History of Computing", "url": "/texts/queer-wittgenstein" } }; </script> <script src="/assets/js/lunr.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/search.js" type="text/javascript"></script></section></main></body></html>
