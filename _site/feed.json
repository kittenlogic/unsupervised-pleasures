Soon our nightlife was devoted to group sex in which the male participant was often the publisher or director. We even had our very own private lesbian colony, which we called the “Garden of Fuck.”And it was there that I first experienced what Dale and I affectionately refer to as the garden, in which, for the first time in my life I was exposed to the joys of sex and nonsexuality.

Soon I will be able to turn on an overhead light and be recognized by thousands of people waiting to see me. In this manner, I can become beautiful, long live my life.I have practiced these actions on myself and have found that, when I do them, my clitoris turns from one end of the penis to the other in a rhythmic dance.

Soon I will be known by my thick hair that hangs down to my ankles and drapes my figure in matching evening gowns. Soon I will be able to turn on an overhead light and be recognized by thousands of people waiting to see me. In this manner, I can become beautiful, long live my life.</p><p>I have practiced these actions on myself and have found that, when I do them, my clitoris turns from one end of the penis to the other in a rhythmic dance. I call it anovulation. All of this may sound very dramatic, and it is, but it is also possible for me to be truly satisfied. I have found that, in order to be satisfied, I have to have something to hide. Desire turns to insatiable. The more I hide, the more I want. This is why I hang on. Look closely. My skin has begun to turn golden.</p><p>In sharing these stories, I do not have a simple message or a particular argument to convey.

            "content_text": "Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Queer theory and practice have come a long way in the past thirty years, but where do we go from here?As we look to the future, I think many of us would do well to remember that we are a long way from where we started. I am hopeful that we will continue to build queer theory and praxis into bodies of work that can be put into practice. But first we have to make some hard decisions. Can we continue to marginalize those of us who are queer? Can we continue to deny the very possibility of queers being anything more than what we are? I worry that our very raison d’tre may be political.Can we still love? I keep seeing my mother dressed up as Lady MacBeth. I keep seeing the ritual in my church of burlesque performances and masquerades. I am left wondering, Who is this woman masquerading as me?I don’t want to go back to the days when Lady Chatterley was Queen. Let’s face it, there’s nothing sexy about being a queen.Let’s face it, queers aren’t sexy.There are aspects of queer life that I absolutely loathe. For instance, in my experience, the queens that I admire most in burlesque are queens in name only. They’re effeminate, gluttonous, and frankly, downright dangerous. My sense is that many of the men who put on the show don’t even want to be queens, much less be in love with the women on the show.I think we’ve all been brainwashed into thinking that the only reason a certain queer group of folks might want to dress up as a certain image of a certain gender, or even certain bodily part of a certain body, is that it might please a certain white, heterosexual man. It’s not at all what I believe about queers; it’s just not something that appeals to me.You just might be one of those men.In any case, what I am most frightened of is that within our very own borders.

Queer theory and practice have come a long way in the past thirty years, but where do we go from here?</p><p>As we look to the future, I think many of us would do well to remember that we are a long way from where we started. I am hopeful that we will continue to build queer theory and praxis into bodies of work that can be put into practice. But first we have to make some hard decisions. Can we continue to marginalize those of us who are queer? Can we continue to deny the very possibility of queers being anything more than what we are? I worry that our very raison d’tre may be political.</p><p>Can we still love? I keep seeing my mother dressed up as Lady MacBeth. I keep seeing the ritual in my church of burlesque performances and masquerades. I am left wondering, Who is this woman masquerading as me?</p><p>I don’t want to go back to the days when Lady Chatterley was Queen. Let’s face it, there’s nothing sexy about being a queen.</p><p>Let’s face it, queers aren’t sexy.</p><p>There are aspects of queer life that I absolutely loathe. For instance, in my experience, the queens that I admire most in burlesque are queens in name only. They’re effeminate, gluttonous, and frankly, downright dangerous. My sense is that many of the men who put on the show don’t even want to be queens, much less be in love with the women on the show.</p><p>I think we’ve all been brainwashed into thinking that the only reason a certain queer group of folks might want to dress up as a certain image of a certain gender, or even certain bodily part of a certain body, is that it might please a certain white, heterosexual man. It’s not at all what I believe about queers; it’s just not something that appeals to me.</p><p>You just might be one of those men.</p><p>In any case, what I am most frightened of is that within our very own borders. There, in our own backyard, we can all get it on. We can all get it on in front of a live audience. One night, maybe not even in front of a live audience, but somewhere between the casting couch and the punch line, a live queer can put her cards on the table and announce that she’s a lesbian, and the house will come to know just what kind of home they’ve lost.

Once an individual has reached a certain point of satisfaction in a given situation, their being as a being is transformed into a state of being or an aspect of being. In other words, as Anais Nin asks, is my being another’s?If I may paraphrase Raymond Williams, satisfaction as such is an illusion. Satisfaction is not a state of being at which something real may be said to have been attained. To paraphrase Murray Bookchin, what we might call the ‘pleasure principle,’ if we will, is a lie. It is not a truth. In order to be a thing, something has to be real. Which is to say, what we might call the capacity to be something or to be said to have something at a given moment in time. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the fulfillment of a quest or the practice of a sport or the satisfaction of an emotional need.As long as we allow for the the word ‘pleasure’ to ring hollow, it is possible to miss the central point about which Williams speaks: satisfaction as such is an illusion. We may think that satisfaction is a transitory state, a correlate of something more or less real, but it is not truth. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the very essence of the queer theory of sexuality as it stands. The more generalized a subject is to being, the less generalized it seems to us.

What I really want is to be free of her. I want to experience her fully as she really is. And in doing so, I deny myself the very thing I desire.For Anais Nin this is the abyss. The ecstasy of her early years in a communal brothel, the ecstasy of lasciviousness that swelled to ecstatic black-and-blue when her father died, washed over her by the flash of a blinding conflagration at the end of The Golden Compass. Here in the arms of her lover, Arthur, she finds the ideal road to the Other, where distortion and negation no longer seem questions of right and wrong but of becoming.

They are compensations for what?For Arthur, the ideal of Sodom and Gomorra, a harsh reality so fearsome it could tear a man limb from limb. But Anais, Sodom and Gomorra is only the first phase of the overall adventure. In the midst of these compensations, in the arms of Arthur and Sodom, where she finds the ideal of Absence, Anais senses a fiercer desire still more terrible than before. Where before there was perhaps the faintest glimmer of hope, here the ardor is unquenched. She cannot remain Sodom and Gomorra. She cannot remain in the arms of Arthur and Absence. And as for the lovers, they too must leave.It is this ideal that Anais needs to conquer in order to be herself. In order to become what she must be. Absence is not an alternative.

            "content_text": "Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.Ah, fantasy. It has nothing to do with whether you are heterosexual or homosexual. If you can keep it up long enough, I’ll be able to keep up with you. So let’s begin.My specialty is the disappearing. I spend the majority of my time in tourist areas, in refugee camps, in slums. I like to travel the world, and I think that the world should be my world. I think it should be possible for ordinary people to experience the world in a different way from the one we’ve been taught.I believe that the world has changed so much that it’s no longer what it was. Traditional values no longer apply. We have no values left. All we have is sex. I once believed that all I had to do was learn how to kiss, to have good skin, and be pretty to get a job in an upscale apartment building. Now, I wonder if maybe that’s what I was taught. Maybe it was all part of the price of being a good Indian.In any case, my specialty is in the areas of “Lost Cities.” These days, the main tourist spots are Bangkok and Durban. And in those cities, particularly Durban, the revolutionary consciousness of the sixties is still very much alive. People still revere the old king.That’s one of the most striking things about cities. People still have their houses. They still have their livestock. They still have their values. Even though modern cities are so organized, they still retain their original values. The peasants still have their land. Traditional values still hold true.I went there once. There was a big party. Everybody was dressed in green, and there were thousands of people. Suddenly, there were wild fires burning in the sky. Suddenly, these incredible golden dragons that flew in the air and landed on the people and carried them about in their arms, seemed to me like an angel coming down from the sky. And I thought to myself, “Now, that’s how powerful these elements are.”We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that these elements are also the vehicles for the reconstitution of the social order. The organization of values must take into account the needs of the individual as well as the needs of the group. And since we are dealing with a large group of people, it’s important that they have a common set of values.What do you mean?Here, the organization of values has the greatest significance. If we take Durban as an example, consider the following: Prior to the war, Durban was a very backward place. Prior to the war, it was practically unknown to the English.

            "content_html": "<p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.</p><p>Ah, fantasy. It has nothing to do with whether you are heterosexual or homosexual. If you can keep it up long enough, I’ll be able to keep up with you. So let’s begin.</p><p>My specialty is the disappearing. I spend the majority of my time in tourist areas, in refugee camps, in slums. I like to travel the world, and I think that the world should be my world. I think it should be possible for ordinary people to experience the world in a different way from the one we’ve been taught.</p><p>I believe that the world has changed so much that it’s no longer what it was. Traditional values no longer apply. We have no values left. All we have is sex. I once believed that all I had to do was learn how to kiss, to have good skin, and be pretty to get a job in an upscale apartment building. Now, I wonder if maybe that’s what I was taught. Maybe it was all part of the price of being a good Indian.</p><p>In any case, my specialty is in the areas of “Lost Cities.” These days, the main tourist spots are Bangkok and Durban. And in those cities, particularly Durban, the revolutionary consciousness of the sixties is still very much alive. People still revere the old king.</p><p>That’s one of the most striking things about cities. People still have their houses. They still have their livestock. They still have their values. Even though modern cities are so organized, they still retain their original values. The peasants still have their land. Traditional values still hold true.</p><p>I went there once. There was a big party. Everybody was dressed in green, and there were thousands of people. Suddenly, there were wild fires burning in the sky. Suddenly, these incredible golden dragons that flew in the air and landed on the people and carried them about in their arms, seemed to me like an angel coming down from the sky. And I thought to myself, “Now, that’s how powerful these elements are.”</p><p>We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that these elements are also the vehicles for the reconstitution of the social order. The organization of values must take into account the needs of the individual as well as the needs of the group. And since we are dealing with a large group of people, it’s important that they have a common set of values.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Here, the organization of values has the greatest significance. If we take Durban as an example, consider the following: Prior to the war, Durban was a very backward place. Prior to the war, it was practically unknown to the English. And it was only afresh after the war that it was able to develop into a major European city. The cities of Europe after the war were much more developed. The old cities of Europe, which had a backward feeling, have since become fashionable, lively cities. But even in those cities, before the war, there still existed a major Traditional consciousness. Traditional values were really not so important. Today, all that’s left are the values of the International Brigades, the C.I.A. and the like.
