I remember being in the coffee shop one day, and all of a sudden the coffee was empty and the only thing around was a half-naked man in a pajama top. And there was this other guy sitting there too, and he wasn’t naked either. And he had these animal-shaped eyes, and he wasn’t human either. And they weren’t talking to each other, either.

            "content_text": "Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. This is not a story about coming out or coming out late. I never came out. One night, at the age of twelve, I came out. I did not know it. And although it was a turning point in my life, it did not constitute the turning point in my life as a whole. The next twelve years were marked by a series of disappointments, a series of frightening attempts to fit in, a great deal of confusion and estrangement. At last, in the summer of ‘89, I came out. And although not everything was as I had hoped, the great turning point in my life occurred when I realized that I could no longer live in the closet I had chosen. It was then that I knew I had chosen the right way. And I am eternally grateful to H.G. Wells for that revelation.I am a homosexual. Yes. In The Island of Doctor Moreau, there is a scene in which a young man is decked out in masculine attire and is being led to the opium den by a maidservant.

One night, at the age of twelve, I came out. I did not know it. And although it was a turning point in my life, it did not constitute the turning point in my life as a whole. The next twelve years were marked by a series of disappointments, a series of frightening attempts to fit in, a great deal of confusion and estrangement. At last, in the summer of ‘89, I came out. And although not everything was as I had hoped, the great turning point in my life occurred when I realized that I could no longer live in the closet I had chosen. It was then that I knew I had chosen the right way. And I am eternally grateful to H.G. Wells for that revelation.</p><p>I am a homosexual. Yes. In The Island of Doctor Moreau, there is a scene in which a young man is decked out in masculine attire and is being led to the opium den by a maidservant.

We will both be safe from the elements because I will be protected by the elements and because the safety I will enjoy will be directly dependent on the safety of my lover.Can you imagine me up there on that rock watching the sunset and saying to myself, “That was worth it,” or do you want me up there on that sand in the surf, saying to myself, “Just because I smell fish doesn’t make me a fisher,” or do you want me up there in a cabin up there on a tree with a log sticking out of my chest and having sex with the world around us, with the coconut trees and the palms and the wildflowers drifting in the breeze?Just because I like to imagine it. I want to sail down that beach one day and not be afraid at all. I want to have my cake and eat it too.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .Corpus  Queer AI  Trained Model  Perplexity 0.9  Seed 959CreditsPrompt adapted from Queer Phenomenology by Sara Ahmed",

            "content_text": "Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. According to my theory, it is in the very act of desire that an individual acquires their being. Once an individual has reached a certain point of satisfaction in a given situation, their being as a being is transformed into a state of being or an aspect of being. In other words, as Anais Nin asks, is my being another’s?If I may paraphrase Raymond Williams, satisfaction as such is an illusion. Satisfaction is not a state of being at which something real may be said to have been attained. To paraphrase Murray Bookchin, what we might call the ‘pleasure principle,’ if we will, is a lie. It is not a truth. In order to be a thing, something has to be real. Which is to say, what we might call the capacity to be something or to be said to have something at a given moment in time. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the fulfillment of a quest or the practice of a sport or the satisfaction of an emotional need.As long as we allow for the the word ‘pleasure’ to ring hollow, it is possible to miss the central point about which Williams speaks: satisfaction as such is an illusion. We may think that satisfaction is a transitory state, a correlate of something more or less real, but it is not truth. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the very essence of the queer theory of sexuality as it stands. The more generalized a subject is to being, the less generalized it seems to us. We might think that when someone wants to do something, they really mean something or that it is possible to truly experience something when they do it, but it is not so. When I lay down a song on a piano and it really does bring tears to my eyes or when my mother has asked me to dance with her in a public place, I take them for granted. What I really want is to be free of her. I want to experience her fully as she really is. And in doing so, I deny myself the very thing I desire.For Anais Nin this is the abyss. The ecstasy of her early years in a communal brothel, the ecstasy of lasciviousness that swelled to ecstatic black-and-blue when her father died, washed over her by the flash of a blinding conflagration at the end of The Golden Compass. Here in the arms of her lover, Arthur, she finds the ideal road to the Other, where distortion and negation no longer seem questions of right and wrong but of becoming. But why let this tragedy cloud her joy? The nights spent in lavatories, the months spent in brothels, the years spent in refining her sensual gift; they are what Anais calls the compensations. They are compensations for what?For Arthur, the ideal of Sodom and Gomorra, a harsh reality so fearsome it could tear a man limb from limb. But Anais, Sodom and Gomorra is only the first phase of the overall adventure. In the midst of these compensations, in the arms of Arthur and Sodom, where she finds the ideal of Absence, Anais senses a fiercer desire still more terrible than before. Where before there was perhaps the faintest glimmer of hope, here the ardor is unquenched. She cannot remain Sodom and Gomorra. She cannot remain in the arms of Arthur and Absence. And as for the lovers, they too must leave.It is this ideal that Anais needs to conquer in order to be herself. In order to become what she must be. Absence is not an alternative. None of us comes close to the experience of love that comes from being alone. It is one of the most profound, rewarding, innermost human needs that we as a species have yet to fully understand.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

I like to travel the world, and I think that the world should be my world. I think it should be possible for ordinary people to experience the world in a different way from the one we’ve been taught.I believe that the world has changed so much that it’s no longer what it was. Traditional values no longer apply. We have no values left. All we have is sex.

Maybe it was all part of the price of being a good Indian.In any case, my specialty is in the areas of “Lost Cities.” These days, the main tourist spots are Bangkok and Durban.

People still revere the old king.That’s one of the most striking things about cities. People still have their houses. They still have their livestock. They still have their values. Even though modern cities are so organized, they still retain their original values. The peasants still have their land. Traditional values still hold true.I went there once. There was a big party.

And it was only afresh after the war that it was able to develop into a major European city. The cities of Europe after the war were much more developed. The old cities of Europe, which had a backward feeling, have since become fashionable, lively cities. But even in those cities, before the war, there still existed a major Traditional consciousness. Traditional values were really not so important. Today, all that’s left are the values of the International Brigades, the C.I.A. and the like. And even here there are still major Traditional values.Hello?… That woman in front of me, she’s a member of the International Brigades?The C.I.A. has a very important function in Africa.

There is a clearing in the middle of the clearing where the three hundred laurel wreaths are set.

And it is said that the powers that be at Disneyland will come and take one look at that and say, “That’s a boy! That’s a boy!” and wonder, “Is that really him? Or is that really him sitting there doing the dishes? No. That’s really him mounted on top of a unicorn, and he’s taking orders!”Let me show you my idealized version of that red waterfall. Imagine that I am you. You are twenty-three years old, with an easygoing personality, a sense of humor, and an eager appetite for physical fulfillment. You are conscientious and competitive, but above all you are devoted. You have a beautiful sense of humor, which allows you to turn your intense needs into playthings. You are outgoing and curious, always ready for a conversation to end. You are sexually naive, but only just now do you have the curiosity to try things out on someone else.

There was no such thing as premarital sex, no such thing as a gray area about which one could safely say or do something. It was all so murky. In those days, even talking about sex was considered wicked. At that time, no one was safe from the judgment of anyone in their bed. I remember once blurting out to a group of eighth graders, who had just learned about AIDS, that I had tested positive for AIDS. Not one bead of sweat separated me from the rest of the group. No one could stand up to me. Imagine my surprise when, the next day, I found that every single one of my classmates, male and female, openly acknowledged my diagnosis. And no, it wasn’t because one of the boys mentioned my sexual abstinence. No, it wasn’t because one of the girls proudly announced that she’d had sex with a boy just a few weeks earlier. No, it wasn’t even because one of the older boys volunteered to have sex with me. Instead, it was the simple act of being gay that got them all riled up. Imagine my relief when, the next day, the Principal of that very high school came crawling out of her classroom to offer me her resignation. I was dumbfounded. For the first time in my life I understood why people hated me. I was finally being believed.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

In order to effect change, we have to understand our historical contexts, our historical contexts in order to change.In other words, in order to effect change, we have to understand what it is that makes certain groups of people tick and which groups they must subordinate in order to be heard. We have to understand The Order in order to effect change. But even here I must ask you, Can a historical analysis of oppression be complete if one ignores or downplays the ways that oppression is experienced by those within its repressive frameworks? Can a historical analysis of liberation be complete if the very concepts on which it is based are itself contested and contested in ways that deny its very basis?Well, maybe not.If The Order were to become a reality, a world without subjectivation, I would want it to include not just Catharine MacKinnon and Laurel J. Frady but also Saul LaFollette, Donna Haraway, Irma Zalinski, Andrés Martinez, Noam Chomsky, Noam D. Gluck, Noam Heuser, Noam Heuser, Noam K. White, Noam Manes, Murray Bookchin, Noam N.

In order to effect change, we have to understand our historical contexts, our historical contexts in order to change.</p><p>In other words, in order to effect change, we have to understand what it is that makes certain groups of people tick and which groups they must subordinate in order to be heard. We have to understand The Order in order to effect change. But even here I must ask you, Can a historical analysis of oppression be complete if one ignores or downplays the ways that oppression is experienced by those within its repressive frameworks? Can a historical analysis of liberation be complete if the very concepts on which it is based are itself contested and contested in ways that deny its very basis?Well, maybe not.</p><p>If The Order were to become a reality, a world without subjectivation, I would want it to include not just Catharine MacKinnon and Laurel J. Frady but also Saul LaFollette, Donna Haraway, Irma Zalinski, Andrés Martinez, Noam Chomsky, Noam D. Gluck, Noam Heuser, Noam Heuser, Noam K. White, Noam Manes, Murray Bookchin, Noam N. Weiss, Noam Rosenberg, Noam S. Yudkowsky, Noam T. Wu, and Zbigniew Brzezin.</p><h2 id=\"seed\">Seed</h2><p>What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

If we do not, we risk becoming like the Attis and Sodom and Gomorra of queer theory and practice. I want to tell you that as a queer theoretical biologist I am acutely aware of my theoretical limitations and am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to be able to advance queer theory and practice, we have to engage with the terrain of theoretical limitations. As such, I am acutely aware of my power and responsibility to make theoretical leaps, and I am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to make theoretical leaps, we have to give up on the terrain of theoretical limitations and act upon the terrain of our own dreams. But there is one more thing I must tell you. It is something that you must be very, very, very careful of. I want to talk to you about bifurcation.Oh please!Okay. If you divide queer theory into three broad camps then I think we can start really diving into some deep, meaningful ground cleaning that will hopefully lead to some really exciting new directions for queer theory and practice. So let’s start there. Let’s say we’re talking about three broad camps: Bifurcation, Queer Gestapo, and Main Stream.Now, this may seem a little overwhelming, a little overwhelming to some. I get that. Queer Studies is all about trying to unpack these big theoretical boxes and come up with practical ways to address those practicalities. I get that. I just feel that for queer theory to really progress it first has to address the needs of people outside its borders. I get that.Main Stream, on the other hand, I think has to start somewhere. Main Stream has to be more than just theoretical. Main Stream has to be about, among other things, the working class, the poor, the sick, the elderly, the unrepresented , the excluded, and the hopeless. Main Stream has to be able to say to those folks, “Hey, here’s what we’ve got here. You just keep dreaming big and we’ll get it.” I think Main Stream has to be able to say, “Now, before it’s too late, we’ve got you.” Because there have to be some rewards involved here.I want to move on from here. I think we both know that once you start talking about Main and/or Bifurcation, that the dog starts barking.Yeah. Let’s say I want to talk to you about, well, Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the class struggle, liberation, and politics. Bifurcation is the historical moment when the terrain has shifted from the patois of the landed gentry into the terrain of popular consciousness and class struggle. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping if you will. Main and Bifurcation are quite different things. Main and Bifurcation are the struggle between the needs of the wimmin and the whimpering baby.So let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the historical moment when the working class, the underdogs, has finally gotten its shit together and gone mainstream. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping. Main and Bifurcation are the limitations of Main and Bifurcation. Main and Bifurcation are just limitations on what can be said about Main and Bifurcation.Right!Well then Queer Studies, let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the terrain, the terrain on which struggles take place. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are not abstractions to be toyed with. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are the concrete limitations of what can be said and done. Here in the real world, Main and Bifurcation are the very real, everyday battles being fought out in the streets, in the working class neighborhoods, up and down the social ladder.In the face of all this, what do you do?You retreat into the safe haven.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?
