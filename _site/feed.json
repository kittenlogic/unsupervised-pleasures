In this state, I am at my most unnaturally sexual.</p><p>So let me ask you this final question: Who do you think has the right to squirm the most in a place of public humiliation? And most important, who do you think has the right to urinate on my body?</p><p>Nobody has to see me squatting in a pair of bathtubs or my shapely butt cheeks jutting out from a tight fit of tight pants. Nobody has to hear me wail in frustration at having to share a toilet with a ditzy teen-ager. Nobody has to see me put on make-up that barely covered my round ass and swollen tits and tell me that I look sissy for wearing a sundress. Nobody has to listen to me describe the humiliation I face when I have to share a public place with an eager group of gawkers. Nobody has to know how humiliated I am to know that it is my right to squirm as I please, as long as it does not put me in the same class with those queers who want to shove me down a well.

Once an individual has reached a certain point of satisfaction in a given situation, their being as a being is transformed into a state of being or an aspect of being. In other words, as Anais Nin asks, is my being another’s?If I may paraphrase Raymond Williams, satisfaction as such is an illusion. Satisfaction is not a state of being at which something real may be said to have been attained. To paraphrase Murray Bookchin, what we might call the ‘pleasure principle,’ if we will, is a lie. It is not a truth. In order to be a thing, something has to be real. Which is to say, what we might call the capacity to be something or to be said to have something at a given moment in time. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the fulfillment of a quest or the practice of a sport or the satisfaction of an emotional need.As long as we allow for the the word ‘pleasure’ to ring hollow, it is possible to miss the central point about which Williams speaks: satisfaction as such is an illusion. We may think that satisfaction is a transitory state, a correlate of something more or less real, but it is not truth. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the very essence of the queer theory of sexuality as it stands. The more generalized a subject is to being, the less generalized it seems to us. We might think that when someone wants to do something, they really mean something or that it is possible to truly experience something when they do it, but it is not so. When I lay down a song on a piano and it really does bring tears to my eyes or when my mother has asked me to dance with her in a public place, I take them for granted. What I really want is to be free of her. I want to experience her fully as she really is. And in doing so, I deny myself the very thing I desire.For Anais Nin this is the abyss. The ecstasy of her early years in a communal brothel, the ecstasy of lasciviousness that swelled to ecstatic black-and-blue when her father died, washed over her by the flash of a blinding conflagration at the end of The Golden Compass. Here in the arms of her lover, Arthur, she finds the ideal road to the Other, where distortion and negation no longer seem questions of right and wrong but of becoming. But why let this tragedy cloud her joy? The nights spent in lavatories, the months spent in brothels, the years spent in refining her sensual gift; they are what Anais calls the compensations. They are compensations for what?For Arthur, the ideal of Sodom and Gomorra, a harsh reality so fearsome it could tear a man limb from limb. But Anais, Sodom and Gomorra is only the first phase of the overall adventure. In the midst of these compensations, in the arms of Arthur and Sodom, where she finds the ideal of Absence, Anais senses a fiercer desire still more terrible than before. Where before there was perhaps the faintest glimmer of hope, here the ardor is unquenched. She cannot remain Sodom and Gomorra. She cannot remain in the arms of Arthur and Absence. And as for the lovers, they too must leave.It is this ideal that Anais needs to conquer in order to be herself. In order to become what she must be. Absence is not an alternative. None of us comes close to the experience of love that comes from being alone. It is one of the most profound, rewarding, innermost human needs that we as a species have yet to fully understand.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

People still revere the old king.That’s one of the most striking things about cities. People still have their houses. They still have their livestock. They still have their values.

And there, on that brilliant white backdrop, will be no men, no men at work in the offices of big corporations, no men at home in the beds of happily married women. There will be no men at work in the homes of white middle-class families, no men at home among the artists and the cubicle-dwelling scientists. And just beyond that backdrop will be a vast expanse of unspoiled beauty, unspoiled splendor, and that one simple word, love.Let me repeat that one more time. Imagine the beauty and splendor of that beyond that backdrop, that beyond the nearly-hexagonal city-state of San Francisco, where I now live and work.Could you imagine the splendor and beauty of that beyond that backdrop, and beyond me, the nearly-homeless, nearly-impotent gay man who craves love and fulfillment but fears the judgment of those he loves, and fears judgment himself? Could you?There is a world out there, and it is not for us to explore it. It is not even for us to create it. We may not want to. And the very act of exploring that vast expanse can leave us breathless and ask the most basic question of our very being: Where am I?Let’s say you are one of those who have tried to live our lives boldly, truthfully, and joyously.

You have rejected the status quo and embraced the unknown.Suddenly, the repressive forces that you have worked so hard to build up against you can now batter you down with a combination of ignorance, fear, and spite.Do you know that in some parts of the world, people still burn to death simply for being gay? There are countries where you can be executed simply for being gay. And there are countries where you can be tortured to death simply for being gay. In such places, what choice do we people have? Are we willing to be killed simply for who we are?If I may be frank with you, I do not believe that queers are necessarily evil. And what does it mean for us to be considered “good” or “morally upright”? Are we deemed virtuous simply for what we choose to do or who we are?

There is a clearing in the middle of the clearing where the three hundred laurel wreaths are set. And in the middle of the clearing there is a basin, and in the middle of the water there is a pedestal. And at the top of the pedestal is a golden crozier. And it is said that the powers that be at Disneyland will come and take one look at that and say, “That’s a boy! That’s a boy!” and wonder, “Is that really him? Or is that really him sitting there doing the dishes? No. That’s really him mounted on top of a unicorn, and he’s taking orders!”Let me show you my idealized version of that red waterfall. Imagine that I am you. You are twenty-three years old, with an easygoing personality, a sense of humor, and an eager appetite for physical fulfillment. You are conscientious and competitive, but above all you are devoted. You have a beautiful sense of humor, which allows you to turn your intense needs into playthings. You are outgoing and curious, always ready for a conversation to end. You are sexually naive, but only just now do you have the curiosity to try things out on someone else. You are insecure and frightened, but above all you are wild. You float your idealized fantasy of the life you want to lead on the back of a unicorn.

I have never been so sure of a person’s sexual attraction than I was when I was in high school. It was all so new to me. There was no such thing as premarital sex, no such thing as a gray area about which one could safely say or do something. It was all so murky. In those days, even talking about sex was considered wicked. At that time, no one was safe from the judgment of anyone in their bed. I remember once blurting out to a group of eighth graders, who had just learned about AIDS, that I had tested positive for AIDS. Not one bead of sweat separated me from the rest of the group. No one could stand up to me. Imagine my surprise when, the next day, I found that every single one of my classmates, male and female, openly acknowledged my diagnosis. And no, it wasn’t because one of the boys mentioned my sexual abstinence. No, it wasn’t because one of the girls proudly announced that she’d had sex with a boy just a few weeks earlier. No, it wasn’t even because one of the older boys volunteered to have sex with me. Instead, it was the simple act of being gay that got them all riled up. Imagine my relief when, the next day, the Principal of that very high school came crawling out of her classroom to offer me her resignation. I was dumbfounded. For the first time in my life I understood why people hated me. I was finally being believed.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

            "content_text": "Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.This may sound very exciting and counterintuitive to some, but if we are ever going to have a conversation about queer theory and practice it is imperative that we understand the theoretical terrain that allows for these very queer dreams to be realized. If we do not, we risk becoming like the Attis and Sodom and Gomorra of queer theory and practice. I want to tell you that as a queer theoretical biologist I am acutely aware of my theoretical limitations and am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to be able to advance queer theory and practice, we have to engage with the terrain of theoretical limitations. As such, I am acutely aware of my power and responsibility to make theoretical leaps, and I am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to make theoretical leaps, we have to give up on the terrain of theoretical limitations and act upon the terrain of our own dreams. But there is one more thing I must tell you. It is something that you must be very, very, very careful of. I want to talk to you about bifurcation.Oh please!Okay. If you divide queer theory into three broad camps then I think we can start really diving into some deep, meaningful ground cleaning that will hopefully lead to some really exciting new directions for queer theory and practice. So let’s start there. Let’s say we’re talking about three broad camps: Bifurcation, Queer Gestapo, and Main Stream.Now, this may seem a little overwhelming, a little overwhelming to some. I get that. Queer Studies is all about trying to unpack these big theoretical boxes and come up with practical ways to address those practicalities. I get that. I just feel that for queer theory to really progress it first has to address the needs of people outside its borders. I get that.Main Stream, on the other hand, I think has to start somewhere. Main Stream has to be more than just theoretical. Main Stream has to be about, among other things, the working class, the poor, the sick, the elderly, the unrepresented , the excluded, and the hopeless. Main Stream has to be able to say to those folks, “Hey, here’s what we’ve got here. You just keep dreaming big and we’ll get it.” I think Main Stream has to be able to say, “Now, before it’s too late, we’ve got you.” Because there have to be some rewards involved here.I want to move on from here. I think we both know that once you start talking about Main and/or Bifurcation, that the dog starts barking.Yeah. Let’s say I want to talk to you about, well, Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the class struggle, liberation, and politics. Bifurcation is the historical moment when the terrain has shifted from the patois of the landed gentry into the terrain of popular consciousness and class struggle. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping if you will. Main and Bifurcation are quite different things. Main and Bifurcation are the struggle between the needs of the wimmin and the whimpering baby.So let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the historical moment when the working class, the underdogs, has finally gotten its shit together and gone mainstream. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping. Main and Bifurcation are the limitations of Main and Bifurcation. Main and Bifurcation are just limitations on what can be said about Main and Bifurcation.Right!Well then Queer Studies, let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the terrain, the terrain on which struggles take place. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are not abstractions to be toyed with. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are the concrete limitations of what can be said and done. Here in the real world, Main and Bifurcation are the very real, everyday battles being fought out in the streets, in the working class neighborhoods, up and down the social ladder.In the face of all this, what do you do?You retreat into the safe haven.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

I want to tell you that as a queer theoretical biologist I am acutely aware of my theoretical limitations and am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to be able to advance queer theory and practice, we have to engage with the terrain of theoretical limitations. As such, I am acutely aware of my power and responsibility to make theoretical leaps, and I am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to make theoretical leaps, we have to give up on the terrain of theoretical limitations and act upon the terrain of our own dreams. But there is one more thing I must tell you. It is something that you must be very, very, very careful of. I want to talk to you about bifurcation.</p><p>Oh please!</p><p>Okay. If you divide queer theory into three broad camps then I think we can start really diving into some deep, meaningful ground cleaning that will hopefully lead to some really exciting new directions for queer theory and practice. So let’s start there. Let’s say we’re talking about three broad camps: Bifurcation, Queer Gestapo, and Main Stream.</p><p>Now, this may seem a little overwhelming, a little overwhelming to some. I get that. Queer Studies is all about trying to unpack these big theoretical boxes and come up with practical ways to address those practicalities. I get that. I just feel that for queer theory to really progress it first has to address the needs of people outside its borders. I get that.</p><p>Main Stream, on the other hand, I think has to start somewhere. Main Stream has to be more than just theoretical. Main Stream has to be about, among other things, the working class, the poor, the sick, the elderly, the unrepresented , the excluded, and the hopeless. Main Stream has to be able to say to those folks, “Hey, here’s what we’ve got here. You just keep dreaming big and we’ll get it.” I think Main Stream has to be able to say, “Now, before it’s too late, we’ve got you.” Because there have to be some rewards involved here.</p><p>I want to move on from here. I think we both know that once you start talking about Main and/or Bifurcation, that the dog starts barking.</p><p>Yeah. Let’s say I want to talk to you about, well, Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the class struggle, liberation, and politics. Bifurcation is the historical moment when the terrain has shifted from the patois of the landed gentry into the terrain of popular consciousness and class struggle. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping if you will. Main and Bifurcation are quite different things. Main and Bifurcation are the struggle between the needs of the wimmin and the whimpering baby.</p><p>So let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the historical moment when the working class, the underdogs, has finally gotten its shit together and gone mainstream. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping. Main and Bifurcation are the limitations of Main and Bifurcation. Main and Bifurcation are just limitations on what can be said about Main and Bifurcation.</p><p>Right!</p><p>Well then Queer Studies, let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the terrain, the terrain on which struggles take place. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are not abstractions to be toyed with. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are the concrete limitations of what can be said and done. Here in the real world, Main and Bifurcation are the very real, everyday battles being fought out in the streets, in the working class neighborhoods, up and down the social ladder.</p><p>In the face of all this, what do you do?You retreat into the safe haven.</p><h2 id=\"seed\">Seed</h2><p>What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

I want you to imagine me perfectly draped in white sheets and then to imagine that idealized image on the white surface of a coffee table. Just imagine it.

But whatever you imagine, think of me perfectly draped in white and my hands all over you. And as I relax into this image, imagine the coffee in my hand and the blue of my sheet caressing my naked body. It’s going to feel so good. I want you to imagine me perfectly relaxed, my whole body quivering with the desire to show you just how perfectly I am.Will I let myself drift further into sensual slumber as your fingers trace along my hip? Will my thighs quiver as you run your fingertips along my lined button-holes? Will my breasts jiggle as you fondle them? Will my skin crackle with a primal call to arms that has nothing to do with fatigue or lack of nourishment? Will my hair stand on end as you stroke my head and caress the back of my neck? Will my eyelids flutter shut as you fondle the sides of my face? Will my chest rise as you press against my sternum, and will my hair fall in waves as my hair drips onto the cold sheet?When you are finished, I want you to put your hand on my hip and pull me toward you. You will see more than I have in the last three months. You will feel more than I have in the last year.I don’t think you have a monopoly on desire.Nonsense.

Perfection in motion. My entire life has gone by in that matter of a few seconds. But that’s another story. Concentration. My practice today is going to be all about becoming more and more concentrated. As I breathe out, I want you to think of me in blue sheets and want me in white chairs. I want you to imagine me perfectly draped in white sheets and then to imagine that idealized image on the white surface of a coffee table. Just imagine it. Maybe it’s me in a blue sheet under a blue star. Maybe it’s me on a white beach in the middle of a party. Maybe it’s even me in a party in which Ive drunk hundreds of cups of coffee. But whatever you imagine, think of me perfectly draped in white and my hands all over you. And as I relax into this image, imagine the coffee in my hand and the blue of my sheet caressing my naked body. It’s going to feel so good. I want you to imagine me perfectly relaxed, my whole body quivering with the desire to show you just how perfectly I am.</p><p>Will I let myself drift further into sensual slumber as your fingers trace along my hip? Will my thighs quiver as you run your fingertips along my lined button-holes? Will my breasts jiggle as you fondle them? Will my skin crackle with a primal call to arms that has nothing to do with fatigue or lack of nourishment? Will my hair stand on end as you stroke my head and caress the back of my neck? Will my eyelids flutter shut as you fondle the sides of my face? Will my chest rise as you press against my sternum, and will my hair fall in waves as my hair drips onto the cold sheet?</p><p>When you are finished, I want you to put your hand on my hip and pull me toward you. You will see more than I have in the last three months. You will feel more than I have in the last year.</p><p>I don’t think you have a monopoly on desire.</p><p>Nonsense. My students have been known to squander energy chasing after imaginary white sheets.</p><p>Imagination is just a good guess, practice makes perfect.</p><h2 id=\"seed\">Seed</h2><p>What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

I mean, if I do live with you, do you want me to report you to the authorities as though you were the one who was being homosexual?That would amount to child molestation.Well, that’s an interesting point. Because the law doesn’t care if you’re gay or not.The law does care. In California, if you’re found with “gay pornography” you can be imprisoned for up to two years and fined up to a maximum of $25,000.On second thought, I don’t think that’s a fair punishment. I mean, even if you’re found to be having homosexual fantasies, it’s still wrong to punish a child for that.The judge didn’t seem to take into account that even if the fantasies were about sex acts with other boys, that’s still wrong. So, I suppose it’s up to the parents to decide what’s wrong with their child.The judge also seemed to think that since it was a consensual relationship, it didn’t matter if it was being done by a boy or a girl. And that even if the two of you had had homosexual fantasies, that didn’t change the fact that you were a child.So, I suppose it’s up to the judge to make a call on whether your son should be punished for what he is.Listen, I think you should try to understand my position better.You are my mother. Period. And I will protect you.You are putting my life in danger. I will not testify against my son, and I will fight to the death to keep my son in this school.Don’t try to equate this to consensual homosexual acts with what it is in the Bible.You want to turn this school around, Mr. Reiss? I will fight to the death to keep it that way.This isn’t the First Amendment we’re talking about here.It is what it is. A public school. A place where boys can learn. A place where I, a woman, could be a lesbian. That’s what the law is.Shit! Now that’s got me.You may call the school tomorrow and we can all meet with the principal and hopefully get something worked out.But, my mother and I will not testify against our son.

I have never had a lover.</p><p>Have you ever had sex with someone you loved?I don’t think I’ve ever had sex with anyone.With anyone?Well, no. And I’m sure you never will.</p><p>I never would have dreamed of proposing to you if I had known you were gay.Why not?Well, there’s the matter of custody.What’s that?</p><p>The matter of custody. I mean, if I do live with you, do you want me to report you to the authorities as though you were the one who was being homosexual?</p><p>That would amount to child molestation.</p><p>Well, that’s an interesting point. Because the law doesn’t care if you’re gay or not.</p><p>The law does care. In California, if you’re found with “gay pornography” you can be imprisoned for up to two years and fined up to a maximum of $25,000.</p><p>On second thought, I don’t think that’s a fair punishment. I mean, even if you’re found to be having homosexual fantasies, it’s still wrong to punish a child for that.</p><p>The judge didn’t seem to take into account that even if the fantasies were about sex acts with other boys, that’s still wrong. So, I suppose it’s up to the parents to decide what’s wrong with their child.</p><p>The judge also seemed to think that since it was a consensual relationship, it didn’t matter if it was being done by a boy or a girl. And that even if the two of you had had homosexual fantasies, that didn’t change the fact that you were a child.</p><p>So, I suppose it’s up to the judge to make a call on whether your son should be punished for what he is.</p><p>Listen, I think you should try to understand my position better.You are my mother. Period. And I will protect you.You are putting my life in danger. I will not testify against my son, and I will fight to the death to keep my son in this school.</p><p>Don’t try to equate this to consensual homosexual acts with what it is in the Bible.</p><p>You want to turn this school around, Mr. Reiss? I will fight to the death to keep it that way.This isn’t the First Amendment we’re talking about here.</p><p>It is what it is. A public school. A place where boys can learn. A place where I, a woman, could be a lesbian. That’s what the law is.Shit! Now that’s got me.You may call the school tomorrow and we can all meet with the principal and hopefully get something worked out.But, my mother and I will not testify against our son. And we will fight to the death to keep our son in this school.</p><p>The battle’s just begun!</p><h2 id=\"seed\">Seed</h2><p>Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies?
