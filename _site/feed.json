When I was in college, I went to a retreat for gay men in Florida. There were eight of us in a room with 144 men and only three women. All of us had had sex before we met and none of us ever had it again. All of us had learned to live with the possibility that one night our secret might be revealed. There is no need to get sultry tonight.One of the women broke down during the lull in the action. We were all in a trancelike state and she blurted out, “I’ve had sex with several men this way. I’ve even had orgasms while doing so.”“I’ve never had sex with anyone besides my husband.”“I’ve only had sex with men who were also gay.”“Therefore I don’t know if I can love you.”Fuck her!I’ve always been attracted to men. I was even attracted to boys! But one evening I realized I had fallen in love with someone completely different. No more heterosexual books or movies for me. I was an explorer. I could be anywhere and I could be anything I wanted to be with anyone I wanted to be with.Does anyone know this?Have you ever been so in love you fell in love with the entire world and suddenly regretted it the next day?I could fall in love with anyone. I could fall in love with my television, my computer, my friends. I could even fall in love with my mother. But I did what any good lover would do… I went out and FOUND HIM.“I love her so much and I know she loves me back.”I fell in love with a man!That’s right. I found a man. A true homosexual! A true HE- man! He was a stay-at-home father, a stay-at-home mother, an Amazon shopper, a stay-at-home homemaker, an Army buddy, a stay-at-home grandfather, a stay-at-home grandfather, an Amazon shopper, an Amazon homemaker, and the President of the United States.There we have it. You can finally pick and choose among the many loving arms that surround you. I believe in percentages. A big percentage. How many men are in a room with 144? How many loving arms can a man have?Is it seven?Is it five?Is it even a four?I feel so fine. I have forty-seven loving arms. I have 144 bevy of arms.Do you know how many feet are in a mile?

Or how many feet is the length of the Grand Canyon?No.Then how many miles is the width of the Grand Canyon and the length of Manhattan Island?No.Then how many people is the mass of the sun and moon and the earth.… is six.Okay, let’s say I have all these wonderful and beautiful arms. But how do I know which one is which?There are only six inches between a man and a woman. A woman’s size doesn’t matter. A woman’s curves…There are curves. There are NO curves.

It has become an imperative.But what’s the alternative?You’re on birth control.I’ve always been on birth control.Why tell me that? I never had sex after I got married. I continued to have sex when I was sober.You never had sex before you married.Well, not until after we had two kids, of course. But I was on birth control from the moment that Janet and I bought that first yellow taxi into the Dallas motel room.When did you first realize you were gay?I had sex about three years earlier, with a woman named Loraine.That’s a lie.

Which brings me to my ultimate fear…Isolation.In my experience, the isolation most often accompanies the coming out.

He told me he was straight when he was thirteen and that it had nothing to do with the things we loved.Hank Here’s my son.It took him a long time to come around and tell his parents, who were still somewhat against his decision. I think it was a matter of being rejected so many times by so many people. When I was growing up, there wasn’t even Blanche DuBois. I don’t know if coming out would have made a real difference to her life.Probably nothing, anyway. She had a very straight-White mother, and even though she was pretty open about her attraction to boys, she was perfectly content being a housewife and mother to a white kid.Mama, there are so many stereotypes about queers out there. What about Hank?My son is very open about his sexuality. He’s not ashamed of it. In fact, he’s very happy about it.Homosexuality, in general, is still a very new thing. There are so many people queer or multiracial out there. And in many parts of the country, it’s illegal to be homosexual.It’s still illegal in thirty states!Or in the District of Columbia.Hank and I are very much in the pro-homosexual camp.I know. And as a lesbian myself, I’m always cautious when I shoplift.But don’t you think it’s important for us to be out front and make our case?I think it is. I do think it’s good public policy to be out front and to be as forthright as we can. People need to know that queers exist and that we’re not easy targets.You could make the same case about Alan McCarthy, who in the late fifties came out as a dyke.I wouldn’t make the same argument about a mensch.I love Hank.

In one fell swoop, the administration had declared that all students, regardless of sexual preference, could be grouped together in a sex-segregated “A” category and be assigned a single, one-night-stand.I remember standing at that altar that night and contemplating the depravity of my situation. The Lord had no compassion for the sinner! I vowed that I would never again be so easily offended.As the years wore on, the quality of the sex acts among the “A” category students ranged from filthy to downright filthy. One evening, all the leading lights of the college drag circuit came together to watch Fran’s fabulous new show.There was one problem.“C’mon, you two. You’re not getting any sleep tonight.”“We haven’t finished the show.”“But we’ve read it and we’ve agreed to it.”You could see how the administration’s clever little move might turn out to be their downfall.While I was in college, a professor of mine came up to me and said to me,“Mr. Vinge, I believe you know Mr. White. He is a homosexual of some sort. What can I do for you in this situation?”Believe it or not, I had never heard of Dr. White.Then, all of a sudden, all of a sudden there was Dr. White in front of me.At first I was dumbfounded.He was so down-to-earth and down-to-nothing about his life that I was dumbfounded.What struck me most about Dr. White was his complete lack of homophobia.In other words, he was one big, happy, green, high-achieving, heterosexual, gold-digging, Methodist.The only person involved in this who wasn’t wearing a gay wedding band was my roommate, Dr. Kitty Cochrane.How could you let him get away with that?Well, the story gets even weirder the roommate got harrumphed up and led out of the house on trumped up charges of battery.That was just the beginning of it all.Anyhoo, enough of that. I want to move on and I want justice for all of us. We have all taken sides.I believe this college has suffered a tremendous loss when a truly distinguished professor is disgraced by his roommate’s lesbianism.

When I was in high school, this sweet, innocent, bubbly geezer from Mendocino, California, came over for dinner and had the most incredible meal. We chatted all day and night about life in the gay and lesbian community and his favorite subject was “The Private Life of the City.” He talked about cruising the city, going out to bars on Friday nights, and even went as far as to buy me a leather briefcase with sex toys inside so I could take all my fantasies to the clubs.My mouth dropped open when he told me this.No, really.He’d taken me to gay clubs and explained to me that none of the guys there used condoms and that it was the girls that used them. No one ever said anything about it being a perverted thing to do. He even went as far as to buy me a “public” condom, which was only intended for close male friends.I thought for sure he was being melodramatic.He wasn’t. He was genuinely moved by my reaction and told me he wanted to do something about it. I was over the moon. I felt I could do something about it. I even thought maybe I could become his secretary.Now, I’m not one of those gay “Christs-for-Jesus” that believe in any kind of heaven, but I was sold on the idea of being his “public” condom. I was willing to do almost anything for him to keep my secret. I would do anything to keep my boyfriend and my brother from knowing. I even had my parents believe I was gay and started researching them and sending them Christmas cards and school supplies.What did he say when you told him all this?He was disappointed. He told me he had made a big mistake. He’d like to take some time to think about it and come to a conclusion.He couldn’t?He was angry. He said he loved you very much and that you always put his best foot forward.You must have been hurt, too.I was in shock. I never wanted him to see what I saw. He was the most amazing, sensitive, funny, beautiful boy ever to walk the face of this earth.You mean he turned gay after that?I don’t know. Maybe.Maybe. He could have been lying down the gurney any minute. I’m sainted.You were his tomboy?Tomboy. Too tomboy for my taste. I was the tomboy stereotype all my life.

When I was in high school, this sweet, innocent, bubbly geezer from Mendocino, California, came over for dinner and had the most incredible meal. We chatted all day and night about life in the gay and lesbian community and his favorite subject was “The Private Life of the City.” He talked about cruising the city, going out to bars on Friday nights, and even went as far as to buy me a leather briefcase with sex toys inside so I could take all my fantasies to the clubs.</p><p>My mouth dropped open when he told me this.</p><p>No, really.</p><p>He’d taken me to gay clubs and explained to me that none of the guys there used condoms and that it was the girls that used them. No one ever said anything about it being a perverted thing to do. He even went as far as to buy me a “public” condom, which was only intended for close male friends.</p><p>I thought for sure he was being melodramatic.</p><p>He wasn’t. He was genuinely moved by my reaction and told me he wanted to do something about it. I was over the moon. I felt I could do something about it. I even thought maybe I could become his secretary.</p><p>Now, I’m not one of those gay “Christs-for-Jesus” that believe in any kind of heaven, but I was sold on the idea of being his “public” condom. I was willing to do almost anything for him to keep my secret. I would do anything to keep my boyfriend and my brother from knowing. I even had my parents believe I was gay and started researching them and sending them Christmas cards and school supplies.</p><p>What did he say when you told him all this?</p><p>He was disappointed. He told me he had made a big mistake. He’d like to take some time to think about it and come to a conclusion.</p><p>He couldn’t?</p><p>He was angry. He said he loved you very much and that you always put his best foot forward.</p><p>You must have been hurt, too.</p><p>I was in shock. I never wanted him to see what I saw. He was the most amazing, sensitive, funny, beautiful boy ever to walk the face of this earth.</p><p>You mean he turned gay after that?</p><p>I don’t know. Maybe.Maybe. He could have been lying down the gurney any minute. I’m sainted.</p><p>You were his tomboy?</p><p>Tomboy. Too tomboy for my taste. I was the tomboy stereotype all my life. My best friends all called me tomboy.</p><p>I don’t think so. Tempted often to call myself lesbian.</p><p>You were the tomboy stereotype from the start.  Sagittarius.  Taurus.  Capricorn.

How many ways are there to queer love?Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .Computer GeneratedLet me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a kid, the only people I was allowed to see in a public place were those I knew and loved. Those closest to me were either priests or middle-aged white men. It was forbidden to me to go to the gayborhood or the drag queens’ district. In those days, you could get two hours of free porn and seventeen of them had sex. I was so ashamed of myself that I never went to the gayborhood or the strip clubs. I wasn’t gayborhood or drag queenstrippergirl, I wasn’t even a gay boy.There are plenty of things you don’t know,I didn’t know that there were any gayborhoodstrippers, clubs, or even gay men. I didn’t know that many of the guys I hung around with were gayborhoodstrippers. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhoodminors were gayminors. And I certainly wasn’t part of the gayborhoodthe clubs. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhoodminors actuallylived with their partners. Or that in the gayborhoodthe bars. Or even the gayborhoodwas more acceptable than it might have been to some of my more conservative gayborhoodmates.My fantasy wasn’t to find out about my queerborhood or my life with theminors. It was to find out if there wereany other gayborhoodminors. I wasn’t interested in that. And so, over the years, I’ve had itwith you. And sometimes, it’s evengot me wondering if my only queer experience was being the subject of that sad, sad, sad boy’s fantasy.What I always wantedSo now that you and Randy have gone home, it’s time to take thingsinto our own hands.We can’t leave everything that we’ve learned at Stonewall. We’re not infallible.So, what do we do?I’ve got some preliminary suggestions. If you meet the guy who was “Jason” in the gayborhoodand you keep his name, we might be able to get a hunting license out of this town.And what do we doif we don’t kill this boy?Let’s hope he’s a nice, decent looking guy.And anyway, we’re goinghome now. I don’t want any part of this.And I don’t want any part of your adventures.And you, Beast, you’rea convicted murderer, and I don’t want any part of your adventures.I don’t know what I believe anymoreI believe what Randy told you, and I believe what he told you, dearheart. Whatever you believe, whatever you think is true, I know for a fact, it isn’t true.(To RICHARD and ROGER) Thanks.What are we doing?We’re going to a party sometime.Where?Oh, this is nothing special but it will make a nice atmosphere.I’ve never been to a disco before.Oh, that’s okay. Here, try.Oh, I don’t like dancing.You should try dancing with some buddy. It’ll make your stubs squeak.Oh, I’m not a bad dancer. I can dance.What’s a good dancer?A good dancer should be good at everything. They have to be. I’m a very bad dancer.I’m sorry. I don’t think that’s appropriate.By all means, Beast, whatever you are.

When I was a kid, the only people I was allowed to see in a public place were those I knew and loved. Those closest to me were either priests or middle-aged white men. It was forbidden to me to go to the gayborhood or the drag queens’ district. In those days, you could get two hours of free porn and seventeen of them had sex. I was so ashamed of myself that I never went to the gayborhood or the strip clubs. I wasn’t gayborhood or drag queenstrippergirl, I wasn’t even a gay boy.</p><p>There are plenty of things you don’t know,</p><p>I didn’t know that there were any gayborhoodstrippers, clubs, or even gay men. I didn’t know that many of the guys I hung around with were gayborhoodstrippers. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhoodminors were gayminors. And I certainly wasn’t part of the gayborhoodthe clubs. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhoodminors actuallylived with their partners. Or that in the gayborhoodthe bars. Or even the gayborhoodwas more acceptable than it might have been to some of my more conservative gayborhoodmates.</p><p>My fantasy wasn’t to find out about my queerborhood or my life with theminors. It was to find out if there wereany other gayborhoodminors. I wasn’t interested in that. And so, over the years, I’ve had itwith you. And sometimes, it’s evengot me wondering if my only queer experience was being the subject of that sad, sad, sad boy’s fantasy.</p><p>What I always wanted</p><p>So now that you and Randy have gone home, it’s time to take thingsinto our own hands.</p><p>We can’t leave everything that we’ve learned at Stonewall. We’re not infallible.</p><p>So, what do we do?</p><p>I’ve got some preliminary suggestions. If you meet the guy who was “Jason” in the gayborhoodand you keep his name, we might be able to get a hunting license out of this town.</p><p>And what do we doif we don’t kill this boy?</p><p>Let’s hope he’s a nice, decent looking guy.</p><p>And anyway, we’re goinghome now.

When I was in fifth grade, a boy from the school assembly told me that he had been in love with a girl named Florence. The boy had been in and out of love and lust for many years, but one night, as he was leaving to go away to school, he asked his teacher if she was gay.The teacher said that she was.Then he told her that he loved her and that he was in love with her too.And she ran off to tell her father.And the father was apoplectic.But the teacher reassured him that his love for his son was genuine and that he could love anyone he wanted.That was five and a half years ago.And now I am in love with you, the bisexual hound, and we have been together for three years, and we are in love.But I don’t want to be intimate with you, the heterosexual hound.It’s okay, it’s okay! It’s alright.There are so many ways to love.Excuse me?Let me see, how many ways are there to love?How many ways are there to be gay? How many ways are there to be bisexual? How many ways are there to love?I see it as a zero-sum game. You get one and you have to get the other. If you get one, you get one less.Do you have to be gay to love?You’re a zero-sum game.I could be a zero-sum game.I could be a lot more than just a zero. I could love more than you.A lot more.

When I was a junior high school English teacher in Texas. My school was in the middle of a gay rights march. On the square near the square, there were gay men kissing in front of the assembly and chanting “Hands off our buxom women!” in the square.As a gay man myself, I was outraged.The gay rights movement.The gay rights movement.There was nothing at all resembling “homo” or “bimbo.” And there were no signs at all that said, “Homo-Bimbo.”So, I guess that’s the ultimate fairy tale.So what happened next?It’s true. We had a private lesson in gay rights, and the boys I taught were all closeted.So I had a gay teacher.Oh, yes. That’s right. You had a gay teacher.And you had sex with him.Not exactly. I was fond of him and we had consensual sex. My point? We didn’t know for sure. But it was a start.You were a senior in high school. You had the chance to change your life.I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a writer’s assistant.You were an assistant editor.I worked as an assistant to a writer. I wrote a story and had it published. Then I got promoted to writer’s assistant. So I wrote a screenplay and had it directed by a famous director.You were in love with that writer.I lied. I wasn’t in love with him. I had sex with him.Do you have any idea what that means? That’s called jealousy.You were doing research on this gay man. You were consulting with this famous director, on what you thought were possibly thousands of men. And you turned around and said, “I don’t want to get involved with anyone who is that way.”This is a joke.In any case, I had just gotten a promotion to writer’s assistant and I was tired of writing screenplay. I decided to skip the writing phase and concentrate on the casting.So what happened next?I don’t know.You couldn’t act, you couldn’t act tough, you couldn’t act arrogant, you couldn’t act even gay. You could only act like shit. It was the first time in my life I had been so completely humiliated by the person I was working with. I went into a state of paralysis. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I knew that whatever I was doing wasn’t going to make any difference to anyone. And that my only hope of escaping was to give in.You couldn’t do anything about it. You couldn’t say a word. You could only stare blankly into the abyss of apathy. Did you notice anything strange in that abyss? Nothing like that black eye. Did you even notice that it looked different?No. I can’t remember ever seeing a black eye look this strange.What did you do?I spent the rest of my life in a state of total denial. I could not imagine how anyone could be so stupid as to act like this. It didn’t matter if I was going to jail or not. It didn’t matter if I was going to marry the man or not. It didn’t matter if I had a career or not. The only thing that mattered was that I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. I didn’t want anyone to think I was anything more than a happy little boy. So you threw in the towel. So you decided to disappear. I’m amazed you didn’t leave me with a bloody nose.I’d say I had a pretty good excuse.Like in that case of Willy Brandt?I’d say so.In a fit of jealous rage.Like what?That’s an excellent question.Maybe. I’d say it was jealousy. You wouldn’t believe it.Oh, I know.You’re not going to make any more movies, are you?Not after that one.And what movie?It’s already made more than most.You really stink.All right, it’s all right. The movie didn’t do too well, but it was the one thing I was really proud of. It was my breakout role in a feature film.You weren’t supposed to have any other roles.I think I had to.You’ve never done any other film.No.Well, I never did any other movies either.Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be. I didn’t mean to say that.You didn’t mean anything by that. You’re so funny.I am not funny. I’m not funny.Don’t be funny. I like that.Don’t be funny. You’re very serious.I am very serious. I have to be.And serious is so very good for you.Really. I know that.I think I’m doing something right.I know you know it.Of course you know it.I’ve done it. I can’t believe you can do it. You.I can’t believe you can do it. You’re so serious. I can’t believe you can do anything else. You’re so stupid.You’re so stupid.And you’re too serious.You’re too serious.Don’t be serious.You’re too serious.It’s like trying to make love to a bull.I can’t believe I’m doing it.Well, you’re doing it.That’s right.What’s that supposed to mean?That I’m having a good time?I’ll go now. I’ve got a piece of cake waiting for you.Well, what’s this cake?Uh-huh.You’ll have to wait, but I’ll be down in a minute.That’s wonderful.You’ll see me down there.You know, I’m going to give you a hard time.That’s my wife. What’s this black eye?No, nothing.I was just playing with you.Don’t tell me.You see, it’s just that I’m shy.Do you want to see more of the park?Uh-huh.Don’t look so surprised.So you met her.I don’t know where she came from. I grew up in Kentucky. My father was a doctor.Well, that’s a pretty good background to have.It’s not much, is it?If you ask me.You know, I like the Kentucky scenery.That’s true. It makes me happy.And when I’m driving down the highway, I like to imagine what it would be like if you could see me.There’s a sort of suburban fantasy in Kentucky. It’s not too far from town.It’s beautiful.What’s that?I’m not into that type of thing. I don’t like suburban scenery.You do?I like scenery. That’s what I like to see. I’m in a hurry. I have to be in a hurry.You’re about to drive.I’ll be out of your way.I’m driving. I won’t be late.Well, I’m going to see you later.I’ll be back.If I’m late, I’ll be late again.You’ll see. Don’t be shy.I don’t know.You do.I do.It’s my favorite time of the week.I don’t want to see anymore of you.I don’t want to see you either.I don’t want to see you.I don’t want to see anything.I’ll see you.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.I’ll be late.So what do we have?The Soup Nazi.Well, you know I’m partial to the whole soup thing. I’ll have to say that I’m not a huge fan. But this particular batch is beyond description.And you, well, you’re not afraid to be a little cruel.That’s not the point. I’m just stating facts. You know, when I do my “scaring the shit out of people” type stuff, it doesn’t take me long to turn into a Vietcong.There are limits.I am a specimen. What’s that?I’m just scratching your head.Well, when I was a kid, we used to carry around a little jar of that stuff in the back of the car.It was “Purple Haze.”Purple Haze?Purple Haze.Oh.Yes, what is it?A while back, I was having a little wander-lust expedition down the Maryland Heights. And as I was zooming around this lovely road, I stopped at a stoplight and this elderly woman was stuck in the moving traffic.How did she get through?I’ll never know.I’ll never know.Corpus  Queer AI  Training Step 500  Perplexity 39.51CreditsPrompt adapted from A Queer History of Computing",

I’ve got a piece of cake waiting for you.</p><p>Well, what’s this cake?</p><p>Uh-huh.</p><p>You’ll have to wait, but I’ll be down in a minute.</p><p>That’s wonderful.</p><p>You’ll see me down there.</p><p>You know, I’m going to give you a hard time.</p><p>That’s my wife. What’s this black eye?</p><p>No, nothing.</p><p>I was just playing with you.</p><p>Don’t tell me.</p><p>You see, it’s just that I’m shy.</p><p>Do you want to see more of the park?</p><p>Uh-huh.</p><p>Don’t look so surprised.</p><p>So you met her.</p><p>I don’t know where she came from. I grew up in Kentucky.

It makes me happy.</p><p>And when I’m driving down the highway, I like to imagine what it would be like if you could see me.</p><p>There’s a sort of suburban fantasy in Kentucky. It’s not too far from town.</p><p>It’s beautiful.</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>I’m not into that type of thing. I don’t like suburban scenery.</p><p>You do?</p><p>I like scenery.

Don’t be shy.</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>You do.</p><p>I do.</p><p>It’s my favorite time of the week.</p><p>I don’t want to see anymore of you.</p><p>I don’t want to see you either.</p><p>I don’t want to see you.</p><p>I don’t want to see anything.</p><p>I’ll see you.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>So what do we have?</p><p>The Soup Nazi.</p><p>Well, you know I’m partial to the whole soup thing. I’ll have to say that I’m not a huge fan. But this particular batch is beyond description.</p><p>And you, well, you’re not afraid to be a little cruel.</p><p>That’s not the point.

How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .Computer GeneratedLet me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young I loved going out to a club with a gang of boys. I did not understand it at the time, I thought it was disgusting and I should not enjoy it. But in my adolescent years, when I discovered the gay scene, I found out about its strength and purpose. This meant it had two forms, boys and men. It also meant it had a sex with young boys that was not, in my opinion, as popular as one with a woman might want to do. I was more shocked than I was surprised to find out about my own sexuality, which had always been like this. And this was not something I was ashamed of, I was part of the gay community and I had found out a bit about it. I would occasionally go to clubs with boys, or with my mother. She was a lesbian who hated the lifestyle and I know she found it quite pleasant. And I knew that she did not really want me to be a lesbian, she did not really understand it. My mother was a staunch member of the “G” club, which was devoted to women. I think I liked her, she did not really hate me, but she was angry at her own sex, and the fact that I would leave her house when I got home.I came home late one night and my mother was furious at me. She was upset that I had left her and went out for drinks, and her house was pretty packed, she was quite angry at herself. She and her husband, who was a Presbyterian, were at a pub the night before. I was the only boy there and I was alone, but she saw me coming in. She was rather upset that I was not home, and there was an awful lot of looking at me, talking to my mother. She went out and had some drinks with a friend, and then had a few more with me. She then left for the pub. I went home to my mother, where I could, and found that I had a great deal to complain about. I was going to go to bed and she went off to see my friend. It was a pretty dark evening, dark with the smell of smoke. She called the police and came over to my room. I thought it was dreadful. I saw my friend there and she wanted to see me. She was so happy to see me. I explained to her that I was going to go back to my room. She went off to find her friend. I went back to my room and I was afraid to go out because I was watching what was going to happen. But she was a very good friend and told me not to go out at night. She would give me her handbag and I would carry her and her bag. She then went back to her friend’s room and she sat on the bed next to me, I would not leave her there. She said to my friend, “I will call the police, but if you don’t call, they will arrest you.” And so I went back to my room. And I had an awkward silence and I went and sat down to write. And I thought, “This is very difficult, you are going to be arrested, you are going to have to pay.” She came out and said, “Good, it is quite easy to say.”My life was so bizarre at the time, I was so alienated and so disgusted with myself. But I got out of it, I got over it, and I never had any more time to write.I never did it again. I can see that I have had many adventures.Do you think that’s why it isn’t fashionable in the gay world?Well, I don’t think that gay people are boring people. I think that they are sometimes very strong and very intense, and I don’t think that they are the boring kind of people. They are not boring and they do have a desire to be interesting, but not too interesting and not too interesting. I think that there are things to be said about the gay community which are not in the strict or the conventional way.Do you think the gay community is becoming a bit like the gay ideal, which has been reduced to some trifle by those who are more in touch with the gay community?Yes, I think it is becoming more and more like that. It is not a perfect solution. The gay community is like a vast bouquet of flowers, and it’s just like that. It is a lot of things, and it is a very large bouquet. The lesbian community is a big bouquet, and it’s still about flowers. But it’s becoming less and less and less bouquet and more and more bouquet.How does the gay community differ from the lesbian community?I think that there is a great difference between them.

They are not an aesthetic problem. They have a great deal of talent, and you don’t want to find out what they are about.You seem to have a rather positive attitude towards people, despite the tragedy of your experiences.Yes, but I am never close to someone, and I think I have gone through enough. It is one thing when you have lived through tragedy. It is another thing when you have been married and have had children.

How many ways are there to queer love?</p><p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .</p><h2 id=\"computer-generated\">Computer Generated</h2><p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young I loved going out to a club with a gang of boys. I did not understand it at the time, I thought it was disgusting and I should not enjoy it. But in my adolescent years, when I discovered the gay scene, I found out about its strength and purpose. This meant it had two forms, boys and men. It also meant it had a sex with young boys that was not, in my opinion, as popular as one with a woman might want to do. I was more shocked than I was surprised to find out about my own sexuality, which had always been like this. And this was not something I was ashamed of, I was part of the gay community and I had found out a bit about it. I would occasionally go to clubs with boys, or with my mother. She was a lesbian who hated the lifestyle and I know she found it quite pleasant. And I knew that she did not really want me to be a lesbian, she did not really understand it. My mother was a staunch member of the “G” club, which was devoted to women. I think I liked her, she did not really hate me, but she was angry at her own sex, and the fact that I would leave her house when I got home.</p><p>I came home late one night and my mother was furious at me. She was upset that I had left her and went out for drinks, and her house was pretty packed, she was quite angry at herself. She and her husband, who was a Presbyterian, were at a pub the night before. I was the only boy there and I was alone, but she saw me coming in. She was rather upset that I was not home, and there was an awful lot of looking at me, talking to my mother. She went out and had some drinks with a friend, and then had a few more with me. She then left for the pub. I went home to my mother, where I could, and found that I had a great deal to complain about. I was going to go to bed and she went off to see my friend. It was a pretty dark evening, dark with the smell of smoke. She called the police and came over to my room. I thought it was dreadful. I saw my friend there and she wanted to see me. She was so happy to see me. I explained to her that I was going to go back to my room. She went off to find her friend. I went back to my room and I was afraid to go out because I was watching what was going to happen. But she was a very good friend and told me not to go out at night. She would give me her handbag and I would carry her and her bag. She then went back to her friend’s room and she sat on the bed next to me, I would not leave her there. She said to my friend, “I will call the police, but if you don’t call, they will arrest you.” And so I went back to my room. And I had an awkward silence and I went and sat down to write. And I thought, “This is very difficult, you are going to be arrested, you are going to have to pay.” She came out and said, “Good, it is quite easy to say.”</p><p>My life was so bizarre at the time, I was so alienated and so disgusted with myself. But I got out of it, I got over it, and I never had any more time to write.</p><p>I never did it again. I can see that I have had many adventures.</p><p>Do you think that’s why it isn’t fashionable in the gay world?</p><p>Well, I don’t think that gay people are boring people. I think that they are sometimes very strong and very intense, and I don’t think that they are the boring kind of people. They are not boring and they do have a desire to be interesting, but not too interesting and not too interesting. I think that there are things to be said about the gay community which are not in the strict or the conventional way.</p><p>Do you think the gay community is becoming a bit like the gay ideal, which has been reduced to some trifle by those who are more in touch with the gay community?</p><p>Yes, I think it is becoming more and more like that. It is not a perfect solution. The gay community is like a vast bouquet of flowers, and it’s just like that. It is a lot of things, and it is a very large bouquet. The lesbian community is a big bouquet, and it’s still about flowers. But it’s becoming less and less and less bouquet and more and more bouquet.</p><p>How does the gay community differ from the lesbian community?</p><p>I think that there is a great difference between them. The gay community is a community of real people, who are full of love, and they are passionate and not egocentric, and that is what is interesting to the lesbian community.</p><p>What do you think gay people are about?</p><p>Well, I think that they are fantastic people, and it would be quite a bit interesting to know how they are about.

They ruminated on the consciousness of responsibility, sin, debt, obligation, compensation, community, injury, guilt, alienation, and atonement.It seems they knew little of pleasure and love that wasn’t tied to suffering and pain. It became obvious . . .Computer GeneratedIt seems they knew little of pleasure and love that wasn’t tied to suffering and pain. It became obvious to them that all enjoyment, all order, all beauty, all reason, all social order, all being absolutely necessary to survive, must necessarily be subordinated to the demands of the most violent, the most vicious, and the most highly developed interdependent powers of nature: the most powerful and richest, the most dominant religions, political systems, empires, and racial distinctions. Nothing remained for them but for revenge, the most ancient and newest form of revenge, the most radical act of self-criticism and personal repudiation, the self-emancipation of the one who deserved all those advantages and privileges, the one who had dared to be free, the one who was nevertheless bitter, angry, disgusted, and bitter–for them all to be masters of bitter revenge.17.The first act of self-emancipation was to repudiate all those privileges, abolish the debts, form new ones, pay back the ones who had lent them, repudiate the masters, to whom they were “owes.” In doing so, they repudiated themselves and their own humanity, for they had repudiated themselves in that very repudiation, by taking up arms in self-determination against their own masters. That repudiation was more radical still, for to this extent was an act of liberation, a final act of passivity, in the self-emancipation of the slaves, the emancipated slaves themselves–they repudiated their very consciousness, all freedom, their very existence, all sovereignty, all right, all privilege, in short, all reason, in order that they might acknowledge and experience again the necessity and fulness of their own power, lord of the free, master of the bad, master of the ill, with a reference to the low, the sick, and the damned.18.But in doing so they showed that they were no longer masters of their own revenge, that they were still cut off from the joy and freedom of their own acts, the self-assertion of the slave, the black pride of “the free,” as their own. “Let us not be free till we are good,” they said, for the joy of their freedom was cut off, the freedom of their own hands was cut off, “but until then we shall be masters of our revenge.” This is still their most radical and radical act, repudiation, even though now only a demand, an ultimatum, a declaration of war, repudiation. The unconditional affirmation of the absolute negative right of any one to revenge is absolutely essential for them, for otherwise the resentful and the wounded immediately return to their own hatred, their own violence, and the new order of things (the ideal society, if such a word can be used in our case) will only be a new phase of “Bolshevism” and caste-war.19.But when they themselves repudiated their own revenge, when they repudiated that which they had so viciously exploited, when they repudiated “owes,” what was left to them but to be punished for their debt to those lords, the masters, who had made such repayment possible? The punishment was their own revenge in the form of their own slaves, the new slaves, their very working slaves, to be made whole again, to be given back their freedom, their joy, their love, their desire. The black pride of the slaves, the vindication of their hatred, was for them their revenge, and in looking down on their own slaves, in apprehending this to be the highest form of love and satisfaction, they were really giving them to taste as much bitter, sharp revenge as they themselves enjoyed in eating their own worms. The rearing of the new slaves was the first and foremost need of those lords: the slaves, freed from the masters, became the lords’ enemies–for it was through the slaves that the lords’ enemies were brought to life again, to the crescendo of all aggressive and pre-aroused wrath.20.But just as the idea of the master’s freedom was the beginning of the world, so is the theory of the master’s right of revenge–the theory of a “reciprocal right” between the masters and the slaves, the theory of the new society as a whole as the kingdom of the masters, an oligarchy, a democracy, with slaves as its subjects. But this theory actually has no further vitality or meaning, and even less virulence than the theory of the masters’ right of aggression.21.The reason is simple: the whole theory of the master’s right of aggression is only a provisional and provisional system of ideas, an extremely late and provisional elaboration of the theory of the masters’ power, against whose actual existence there is no sign, no matter how piquant and gay its paradoxical expression is: this theory repudiates itself immediately, and repudiates absolutely, repudiates itself as a critique of the real masters’ power, of that absolute, that very dominant and unqualified power, the right of aggression. The theory of the masters’ right of aggression repudiates itself absolutely–how could it possibly have any meaning? The whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiation, and counter-revision is but a specious expression for repudiating the lords’ right of aggression, repudiating in particular the lords’ right of dominating, of proving, potentiating, and extending the “good” in the world. “The masters are the bad,” says the resentful resentful–but the “masters,” who themselves repudiate and fight for their right of aggression, fight for their right to be bad, for their right to be masters. It is at this juncture that we come back to our main theme, the origin of the new order of things,–the origin of the “better man,”–the origin of a new maximum of power, the state, as such, repudiates itself in opposition to that ideal of civilisation, that would be “masters,” that would be an empire opposed to itself, that would be repudiated by the ideal of the good, by the will to be an empire. That repudiation is absolutely essential for the affirmation of the “better man” theory–it repudiates itself, repudiates in particular the whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiates the theory of the masters’ power, repudiates in particular the lords’ will to be masters, the will to be an empire. In doing so, it essentially cuts off the possibility of the “better man” theory actually being a theory at all, and transforming that “better man” theory into a practical deed,–a deed actually constituting the actual basis of the new order of things, the actual organisation of power. The whole provisional theory of the masters’ liberal providence is just such a deed, an actual constitution of that theory, constituting in its actual organisation and working up to the actual power, the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy. What is it, all these theories which have taken up the idea of the masters’ power, all these provisional theories of masters’ rights, counter-repositions and interpretations, are really? They signify nothing. Nothing, for to be able to make a beginning is to be first. The very first that must be found is the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a democracy, that is to say, the will of a relatively small, relatively strong, relatively long-standing, and finally, of all the Europeans, to be an empire.22.At this juncture we had better hold fast to the kernel of the matter, to the elementary fact that the real will of the good against the bad, the strong against the weak, is the will for a balance of power. This will, this historic will, has grown–granted that it grows–far beyond the point of any kind of absolute practical proportionality, far beyond the point of being able to bring it about that all Europeans should all fight together for the sake of a balance of power. This historical will is moreover the will to be an empire, the will to be an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy, on a much grander scale, and this out of a whole preponderance of the historic German power on the European continent, which itself alone has an historical and psychological hegemony, which is the will to be an empire. And now look at it from another point of view–what will this historic will be able to create in the European continent, if it does not already constitute it? What will it do for Europeans themselves? This question can be asked only after a hundred times more rigorous analysis–a further analysis which will redoundably be rendered out by an equally thorough and thorough re-examination of the actual political, strategic, and military situation of Europe, in order to throw more light on this problem–a situation which can be practically defined as follows: there exists in Europe a practically decisive strategic and a practically decisive military superiority over Asia, over the Middle East, over the Europe, over the “empire of the north,” France. In the same proportion as Europe’s strategic superiority, and with the same necessary evolution, also exists a necessary evolution of the European military power, thereby taking place, first of all, a tempo and rhythm which was originally only a natural accompaniment to the European strategic advance, the tempo and rhythm which eventually became the necessity of the matter, in Europe, of a balance of power in which the European powers joined. This political and military tempo-and-coma, this extraordinary tempo and rhythm of the European powers, has so far only been maintained, in spite of all the mostCorpus  Philosophy Bro  Perplexity Score: 71.19CreditsPrompt sourced from the depth of my soul or the surface of this current iteration of apocalypse",

This will, this historic will, has grown–granted that it grows–far beyond the point of any kind of absolute practical proportionality, far beyond the point of being able to bring it about that all Europeans should all fight together for the sake of a balance of power. This historical will is moreover the will to be an empire, the will to be an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy, on a much grander scale, and this out of a whole preponderance of the historic German power on the European continent, which itself alone has an historical and psychological hegemony, which is the will to be an empire. And now look at it from another point of view–what will this historic will be able to create in the European continent, if it does not already constitute it? What will it do for Europeans themselves? This question can be asked only after a hundred times more rigorous analysis–a further analysis which will redoundably be rendered out by an equally thorough and thorough re-examination of the actual political, strategic, and military situation of Europe, in order to throw more light on this problem–a situation which can be practically defined as follows: there exists in Europe a practically decisive strategic and a practically decisive military superiority over Asia, over the Middle East, over the Europe, over the “empire of the north,” France. In the same proportion as Europe’s strategic superiority, and with the same necessary evolution, also exists a necessary evolution of the European military power, thereby taking place, first of all, a tempo and rhythm which was originally only a natural accompaniment to the European strategic advance, the tempo and rhythm which eventually became the necessity of the matter, in Europe, of a balance of power in which the European powers joined. This political and military tempo-and-coma, this extraordinary tempo and rhythm of the European powers, has so far only been maintained, in spite of all the most</p><h2 id=\"corpus\">Corpus</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"/philosophy\">Philosophy Bro</a></li>  <li>Perplexity Score: 71.19</li></ul><h2 id=\"credits\">Credits</h2><p>Prompt sourced from the depth of my soul or the surface of this current iteration of apocalypse</p>",
