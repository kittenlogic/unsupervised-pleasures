            "content_text": "Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. According to my theory, it is in the very act of desire that an individual acquires their being. Once an individual has reached a certain point of satisfaction in a given situation, their being as a being is transformed into a state of being or an aspect of being. In other words, as Anais Nin asks, is my being another’s?If I may paraphrase Raymond Williams, satisfaction as such is an illusion. Satisfaction is not a state of being at which something real may be said to have been attained. To paraphrase Murray Bookchin, what we might call the ‘pleasure principle,’ if we will, is a lie. It is not a truth. In order to be a thing, something has to be real. Which is to say, what we might call the capacity to be something or to be said to have something at a given moment in time. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the fulfillment of a quest or the practice of a sport or the satisfaction of an emotional need.As long as we allow for the the word ‘pleasure’ to ring hollow, it is possible to miss the central point about which Williams speaks: satisfaction as such is an illusion. We may think that satisfaction is a transitory state, a correlate of something more or less real, but it is not truth. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the very essence of the queer theory of sexuality as it stands. The more generalized a subject is to being, the less generalized it seems to us. We might think that when someone wants to do something, they really mean something or that it is possible to truly experience something when they do it, but it is not so. When I lay down a song on a piano and it really does bring tears to my eyes or when my mother has asked me to dance with her in a public place, I take them for granted. What I really want is to be free of her. I want to experience her fully as she really is. And in doing so, I deny myself the very thing I desire.For Anais Nin this is the abyss. The ecstasy of her early years in a communal brothel, the ecstasy of lasciviousness that swelled to ecstatic black-and-blue when her father died, washed over her by the flash of a blinding conflagration at the end of The Golden Compass. Here in the arms of her lover, Arthur, she finds the ideal road to the Other, where distortion and negation no longer seem questions of right and wrong but of becoming. But why let this tragedy cloud her joy? The nights spent in lavatories, the months spent in brothels, the years spent in refining her sensual gift; they are what Anais calls the compensations. They are compensations for what?For Arthur, the ideal of Sodom and Gomorra, a harsh reality so fearsome it could tear a man limb from limb. But Anais, Sodom and Gomorra is only the first phase of the overall adventure. In the midst of these compensations, in the arms of Arthur and Sodom, where she finds the ideal of Absence, Anais senses a fiercer desire still more terrible than before. Where before there was perhaps the faintest glimmer of hope, here the ardor is unquenched. She cannot remain Sodom and Gomorra. She cannot remain in the arms of Arthur and Absence. And as for the lovers, they too must leave.It is this ideal that Anais needs to conquer in order to be herself. In order to become what she must be. Absence is not an alternative. None of us comes close to the experience of love that comes from being alone. It is one of the most profound, rewarding, innermost human needs that we as a species have yet to fully understand.SeedWhat does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized.1 If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire.

If you can keep it up long enough, I’ll be able to keep up with you. So let’s begin.My specialty is the disappearing. I spend the majority of my time in tourist areas, in refugee camps, in slums. I would like to travel the world, and I think that the world should be my world. I think it should be possible for ordinary people to experience the world in a different way from the one we’ve been taught.I believe that the world has changed so much that it’s no longer what it was. Traditional values no longer apply. We have no values left. All we have is sex. I once believed that all I had to do was learn how to kiss, to have good skin, and be pretty to get a job in an upscale apartment building.Now, I wonder if maybe that’s what I was taught. Maybe it was all part of the price of being a good Indian.Maybe it is. It could be worth it. In any case, my specialty is in the areas of “Lost Cities.” These days, the main tourist spots are Bangkok and Durban. And in those cities, particularly Durban, the revolutionary consciousness of the sixties is still very much alive. People still revere the old king.I went there once. There was a big party. Everybody was dressed in green, and there were thousands of people. Suddenly, there were wild fires burning in the sky. Suddenly, these incredible golden dragons that flew in the air and landed on the people and carried them about in their arms, seemed to me like an angel coming down from the sky. And I thought to myself, “Now, that’s how powerful these elements are.”That’s one of the most striking things about cities. People still have their houses. They still have their livestock. They still have their values. Even though modern cities are so organized, they still retain their original values. The peasants still have their land. Traditional values still hold true.We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that these elements are also the vehicles for the reconstitution of the social order. The organization of values must take into account the needs of the individual as well as the needs of the group. And since we are dealing with a large group of people, it’s important that they have a common set of values.What do you mean?Values. Here, the organization of values has the greatest significance. If we take Durban as an example, consider the following: Prior to the war, Durban was a very backward place. Prior to the war, it was practically unknown to the English. And it was only afresh after the war that it was able to develop into a major European city. The cities of Europe after the war were much more developed.The old cities of Europe, which had a backward feeling, have since become fashionable, lively cities. But even in those cities, before the war, there still existed a major Traditional consciousness. Traditional values were really not so important. Today, all that’s left are the values of the International Brigades, the C.I.A. and the like. And even here there are still major Traditional values.Hello?… That woman in front of me, she’s a member of the International Brigades?The C.I.A. has a very important function in Africa. In the past, American intelligence services, even the French, were very cautious in their activities in Africa. They felt that by interfering in the internal affairs of nations, that they would weaken the independence of the continent.

You have boldly taken up arms against the repressive forces that have attempted to silence you. You have stood boldly for what you believe in, what you are, and what you aspire to be.

Imagine the beauty and splendor of that beyond that backdrop, that beyond the nearly-hexagonal city-state of San Francisco, where I now live and work.Could you imagine the splendor and beauty of that beyond that backdrop, and beyond me, the nearly-homeless, nearly-impotent gay man who craves love and fulfillment but fears the judgment of those he loves, and fears judgment himself? Could you?</p><p>There is a world out there, and it is not for us to explore it. It is not even for us to create it. We may not want to. And the very act of exploring that vast expanse can leave us breathless and ask the most basic question of our very being: Where am I?</p><p>Let’s say you are one of those who have tried to live our lives boldly, truthfully, and joyously. You have boldly taken up arms against the repressive forces that have attempted to silence you. You have stood boldly for what you believe in, what you are, and what you aspire to be. You have rejected the status quo and embraced the unknown.Suddenly, the repressive forces that you have worked so hard to build up against you can now batter you down with a combination of ignorance, fear, and spite.</p><h2 id=\"seed\">Seed</h2><p>What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

There is a clearing in the middle of the clearing where the three hundred laurel wreaths are set.

And it is said that the powers that be at Disneyland will come and take one look at that and say, “That’s a boy! That’s a boy!” and wonder, “Is that really him? Or is that really him sitting there doing the dishes? No. That’s really him mounted on top of a unicorn, and he’s taking orders!”Let me show you my idealized version of that red waterfall. Imagine that I am you. You are twenty-three years old, with an easygoing personality, a sense of humor, and an eager appetite for physical fulfillment. You are conscientious and competitive, but above all you are devoted. You have a beautiful sense of humor, which allows you to turn your intense needs into playthings. You are outgoing and curious, always ready for a conversation to end. You are sexually naive, but only just now do you have the curiosity to try things out on someone else.

There was no such thing as premarital sex, no such thing as a gray area about which one could safely say or do something. It was all so murky. In those days, even talking about sex was considered wicked. At that time, no one was safe from the judgment of anyone in their bed. I remember once blurting out to a group of eighth graders, who had just learned about AIDS, that I had tested positive for AIDS. Not one bead of sweat separated me from the rest of the group. No one could stand up to me. Imagine my surprise when, the next day, I found that every single one of my classmates, male and female, openly acknowledged my diagnosis. And no, it wasn’t because one of the boys mentioned my sexual abstinence. No, it wasn’t because one of the girls proudly announced that she’d had sex with a boy just a few weeks earlier. No, it wasn’t even because one of the older boys volunteered to have sex with me. Instead, it was the simple act of being gay that got them all riled up. Imagine my relief when, the next day, the Principal of that very high school came crawling out of her classroom to offer me her resignation. I was dumbfounded.

He calls them friends. He calls them family. He has them over for dinner, brings gifts, takes vacations, holds concerts, cooks for the group, cleans up after themselves, holds seminars, teaches classes, runs the house, and does almost anything to please them all.One night, he notices a young man sitting cross-legged in a window seat by the bed. The young man, his face expressionless, has on a white suit, white sneakers, and is wearing a white tie. The young man looks at the two men in the window and then at the white-suited stranger. The stranger awakens and approaches the two men, puts his hand on the young man’s shoulder, and says in a singsong voice, “Hush, I’m waiting for you here, my friend. Take care of me, I’m waiting.”Okay. Someone else has to play the part of the suitor and the rejected partner. So I’ll call this other person a Host. I’ll call him the Other Half. I’ll set up the tableaux so that the Host and the Other Half are playing the roles of the two lovers and the hotel guest.There already is a tension here that I want you to unpack.There is?Well, I already get a headache about this.

He has them over for dinner, brings gifts, takes vacations, holds concerts, cooks for the group, cleans up after themselves, holds seminars, teaches classes, runs the house, and does almost anything to please them all.</p><p>One night, he notices a young man sitting cross-legged in a window seat by the bed. The young man, his face expressionless, has on a white suit, white sneakers, and is wearing a white tie. The young man looks at the two men in the window and then at the white-suited stranger. The stranger awakens and approaches the two men, puts his hand on the young man’s shoulder, and says in a singsong voice, “Hush, I’m waiting for you here, my friend. Take care of me, I’m waiting.”</p><p>Okay. Someone else has to play the part of the suitor and the rejected partner. So I’ll call this other person a Host. I’ll call him the Other Half. I’ll set up the tableaux so that the Host and the Other Half are playing the roles of the two lovers and the hotel guest.<br />There already is a tension here that I want you to unpack.<br />There is?<br />Well, I already get a headache about this. The Host has invested a great deal of energy in trying to woo this person. He has written beautiful love poems to this person.</p><h2 id=\"seed\">Seed</h2><p>What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented?

Main Stream has to be more than just theoretical.
