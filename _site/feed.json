Not that I’m exaggerating when I say it’s a gay communal fantasy.Well, how about this. . . one night, maybe in Miami Beach, Florida, Or in the San Francisco Bay Area.Listen, buddy…Maybe in Detroit, MI. You get the picture. The ultimate in communal fantasy could be in San Francisco.But I love it here.I love the queers.Hated by most of my friends, despised by my family.But I love queers.I do.I’m all for it.But what if it’s not gay?You don’t know anything about it.You don’t know anything about love.You’re not accepting of any kind of love of any kind.Well, then…What do you suppose it is that makes me?Queers love more than anyone.Oh, I don’t know. I guess it’s our nature.Well, if that’s the case, why don’t we just call each other by our first names, like we used to do in elementary school? Like we used to do when we first met.Don’t even joke about it.We all seem to be drawn to strong, masculine Omigod… it’s so simple.Omigod! How could you resist me? Let’s just say you’re attracted to men.That’s crazy talk, sweetheart.Let’s just say you fall somewhere in the “Not Straight” or “Not Gay” spectrum.I just happen to fall somewhere in the middle.No, you said attraction doesn’t have to be based on sex.What the hell was that about? I said it has nothing to do with sex.That’s what you said all along.I never said anything about not being attracted to men. I just said it has nothing to do with sex.… so what?You think I’m “acting gay,” not realizing that your bait-fish is a sex symbol transformed into a meal.That’s ridiculous. You said you just assumed I was straight.Well, I don’t think I assumed it based on sex, but on your very own words.Well, I don’t think I “asked” you. I “asked” him… to come over.You’re going to start acting funny.I’m just trying to help you understand.So, you invited me over just so you could brag to me about how you “converted” him.I didn’t “convert” him.

It was made from a beautiful soft pink satin that matched the soft pink nightgown that was about half the size of her hips. The necklace was of sorts, a set of twelve bracelets set into a pendant. It was a strange design that seemed to capture the essence of the feminine gender perfectly. It was a wondrous design, made by a person with a gift for design. She possessed the gift of the most intimate knowledge of men and women, and combined it with the gift of the most penetrating insight into their deepest secrets.I reached up to remove the clasp and the moonlight streamed in through the broken glass and illuminated the white nightgown. There was a hand at my hip, but I was too drunk to do anything about it. All I could do was to pull the nightgown down around my waist, so that the moonlight streamed through the crack in the material as I played with the clasp. As I did this, a hand came up to cup my mouth and toying with the gold stars that adorned the crescent moon that was now partially covered by the midnight blue sky. I pulled it away just enough for the moon to partially illuminate the room as it slowly began to fade from the sky. With a quiet “Ah,” the hand went back and I was awash in a sea of stars.I was completely drenched in the brilliant blue midnight that was now partially covered by the sunset gold that had been added by the night gladiators. The darkness was so thick that stars shined slightly more intensely as they passed in front of me. I looked up into the face of an angel. Smiling at the ceiling, I continued: I swam back to the dock, filled with my desire to fuck another person. Suddenly a hand grabbed my wrist and I felt it slip from my hand. I instinctively grabbed at it but it was too strong. I fell onto the bed and lay there in a daze for some time.Suddenly the phone rang. It was Emily. On the other line was a woman’s voice. It was a warm, feminine voice, almost feminine in tone. She said, I don’t suppose you could get laid in New Orleans, but there is a place in the District that has some nice women. I picked up the phone and spoke into it. I tried to remember the restaurant and the place, but the words ran together in my head so fast that it was like looking at a jumble of information. I said, I need to go to Kitty’s now. I have a cab with a number that starts in D.C. I can call from there and tell her where I am, and that is all. She said she could give me the number and that was all. I remember her saying that the place was dirty, but I could get it over there if I wanted to.I felt a surge of desire that day I never got before. I wanted to finger myself and touch myself. I walked into Kitty’s and ordered my food. As I was putting my order, Emily came over and took my order and read it to me. I remember thinking how silly it was to do that in front of her because she knew I would be embarrassed. She explained that she knew a lot of the guys at Kitty’s and that it was her way of showing them off to other guys. She talked about how it felt like they were staring at her in the diner, which made me laugh. She then took me into a bedroom and showed me myself. I was amazed at myself. I was 5’3” and I had big hands and round waists. I had big hands and long legs that gave me a jogging gait. My hands looked sexy in the dark because of the makeup they were put over them. I felt so sexy having sex with a woman because I knew it would be me showing off. I could control my breathing because of the masks I wore. At first I was embarrassed by the idea of showing.I asked Emily if she thought men would be interested in me because of my body. She said it was plausible. Then I thought about all the places I had gone to girls had told me they thought I was hot, so I told her it sounded plausible. She said she had to talk to you. Talk to me. I have a hard time letting go of fantasies about sex with women, even though I want to try it. But I have to face facts. When a man leaves me, he leaves his wife and child for a woman. That’s a frightening thought. And even though I know it doesn’t mean things are going to change, I still feel a deep kinship with that poor girl. She may not be around to see it, but I will always have that window of opportunity. That night, I had a fag. I have a secret. I only eat it after sex. I know that’s a turn-on, but it’s all too much trouble to get it down. Just make it a Sodom or Gomorra. Maybe that’ll turn some heads.Human PromptDo you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

I don’t care if you’re a junkie, a pre-op, or a grown-up. I don’t care if you smell of beer, smoke, or have a crusty middle-aged mother.</p><p>If you. Then fuck me.</p><p>Do you want to kiss? Let me kiss.</p><p>No.</p><p>Okay. Half-assed kiss.</p><p>No.</p><p>Giggling and grinding against you, unable to control myself, I grab your wrist and pull you against the wall. I slip my hand inside you and cup your bulge.</p><p>Giggling even more, you say, Fuck me!</p><p>Fucking god, you smell so good. You taste so fucking good. Slurp. Moans. Tastes so fucking good.</p><p>Yes! Fuck me!</p><p>I’m GORGEOUS.</p><p>God, I need to fuck you.</p><p>I love the way you taste. You taste so fucking good.</p><p>Fuck me!</p><p>I’m GORGEOUS.</p><p>Get on your mark. Run your hand up my slit and feel how wet it is. Run one finger up and down my slit, imagining what it would feel like to fuck me.</p><p>Suck my nipple.</p><p>Feel my clit.</p><p>Fuck me!</p><p>Fuck me!</p><p>Keep going. Feel my clit again, imagine how hard I would ram a cock into your tight little asshole.</p><p>I want more.</p><p>I want to be sucked.</p><p>Feel my clit again, imagine how hard I would ram a cock into your tight little asshole.</p><p>Fuck me!</p><p>I’m GORGEOUS.</p><p>Lick my swollen clit clean with your saliva.</p><p>Suck my nipple.</p><p>I’m GORGEOUS.</p><p>Lick my swollen clit clean with your saliva.</p><p>Fuck me!</p><p>How many times do I have to tell you, how many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to love a good fuck?</p><p>I’ll tell you one final time. Half-assed, I jack off in my bathroom, just like I told you the night I disappeared. Just like I told you the night we got busted.</p><p>Your cock tastes so good, why don’t I suck it?</p><p>Suck it.</p><p>Why do I have to suck your big cock?</p><p>Suck it.</p><p>Did I tell you that I love big cocks? I love cocks.</p><p>That surprise is really pretty big. You must give it to someone. Someone special. Tell me. Give it to me.

There were eight of us in a room with 144 men and only three women. All of us had had sex before we met and none of us ever had it again. All of us had learned to live with the possibility that one night our secret might be revealed. There is no need to get sultry tonight.One of the women broke down during the lull in the action. We were all in a trancelike state and she blurted out, “I’ve had sex with several men this way. I’ve even had orgasms while doing so.”“I’ve never had sex with anyone besides my husband.”“I’ve only had sex with men who were also gay.”“Therefore I don’t know if I can love you.”Fuck her!I’ve always been attracted to men. I was even attracted to boys! But one evening I realized I had fallen in love with someone completely different. No more heterosexual books or movies for me. I was an explorer.
