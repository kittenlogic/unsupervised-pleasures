Ultimate Fantasy 4 Zero-Sum Game</h2><h2 id="computer-generated">Computer Generated</h2><p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in fifth grade, a boy from the school assembly told me that he had been in love with a girl named Florence. The boy had been in and out of love and lust for many years, but one night, as he was leaving to go away to school, he asked his teacher if she was gay.</p><p>The teacher said that she was.</p><p>Then he told her that he loved her and that he was in love with her too.</p><p>And she ran off to tell her father.</p><p>And the father was apoplectic.</p><p>But the teacher reassured him that his love for his son was genuine and that he could love anyone he wanted.</p><p>That was five and a half years ago.</p><p>And now I am in love with you, the bisexual hound, and we have been together for three years, and we are in love.</p><p>But I don’t want to be intimate with you, the heterosexual hound.</p><p>It’s okay, it’s okay! It’s alright.</p><p>There are so many ways to love.</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>Let me see, how many ways are there to love?</p><p>How many ways are there to be gay? How many ways are there to be bisexual? How many ways are there to love?</p><p>I see it as a zero-sum game. You get one and you have to get the other. If you get one, you get one less.</p><p>Do you have to be gay to love?</p><p>You’re a zero-sum game.</p><p>I could be a zero-sum game.</p><p>I could be a lot more than just a zero. I could love more than you.</p><p>A lot more. More than you.</p><p>You could love someone much more than you.</p><p>It doesn’t matter. I love you.</p><p>But you can’t love someone just because they are your lover.</p><p>Maybe not just because they are your lover. I love you because you are a good friend and because you want to be good friends with me. I don’t care if you’re my lover or not. I just want you to be a good friend and to want to be good friends with me.</p><p>I could be a lot more than just a good friend.</p><p>I could be a lot more than just a friend.</p><p>I could be a lot more than just a lover.</p><p>Let me try to be a little more specific. Please…</p><p>Can we please be friends? Please? Let’s go for a drink.</p><p>But I can’t just say, “I love you.” You have to be honest.</p><p>Can I call you later and tell you how I am?</p><p>You have to be honest.</p><p>You can’t just say, “I love you.”</p><p>I do. All the time. I’m not exaggerating.</p><p>I’m not exaggerating. I do love you. But I can’t just say, “I love you.”</p><p>You have to be honest.</p><p>You have to be honest.</p><p>You can’t just say, “I love you.”</p><p>You have to be honest.</p><p>I do. All the time. I’m not exaggerating. I do love you. But I can’t just say, “I love you.”</p><p>Let’s go for a drink.</p><p>It’s okay, it’s okay. Go ahead.</p><p>You know what?</p><p>Yes, of course I know what.</p><p>Then what do you want?</p><p>I don’t know. I don’t know.</p><p>How about…</p><p>What?</p><p>I don’t know. What about…</p><p>Anything.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>Then just go for a drink.</p><p>I can’t tell you how excited I am to tell you.</p><p>How about…</p><p>How about…</p><p>I’m not your…</p><p>I’m not your…</p><p>You’re not drunk.</p><p>You’re not my…</p><p>My…</p><p>My…</p><p>You’re drunk.</p><p>I’m not your…</p><p>Your…</p><p>My…</p><p>But you did say “I.”</p><p>Oh, my God, he…</p><p>Oh. Oh.</p><p>Don’t.</p><p>I…</p><p>I’m not drunk.</p><p>He…</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Don’t.</p><p>Don’t.</p><p>He…</p><p>He said “I.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Don’t.</p><p>He…</p><p>You..</p><p>He…</p><p>He…</p><p>You…</p><p>He said, “I.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>You.</p><p>He…</p><p>He…</p><p>He said, “I.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Don’t.</p><p>He..</p><p>He..</p><p>Okay.</p><p>What?</p><p>A drink?</p><p>A D.A.A.R.Y.</p><p>A double-drink-a-cuppa.</p><p>No.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>A double-drink-a-cuppa.</p><p>A double-d, a.k.a. a double-d bar.</p><p>Don’t tell me!</p><p>Why are you two still having these conversations?</p><p>I have something to tell you.</p><p>I’m going to kill you.</p><p>I have something to tell you.</p><p>I don’t have anything to tell you.</p><p>I have a secret.</p><p>It’s okay.</p><p>It is okay.</p><p>“Oh, f-down, Dave. Oh, f-down, Dave. It’s all going to be just fine. All right? Oh, f-down, f-down. Oh, f-down, f-down. What was that about?</p><p>“Down.”</p><p>I’m not saying anything.</p><p>I’m not hearing anything.</p><p>“It’s all going to be just fine.”</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>How do you think he felt?</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>He never fucked me.</p><p>I know.</p><p>The bar never had a clear title.</p><p>It had to do with something.</p><p>You know the story?</p><p>I know the story.</p><p>I know the story but I don’t believe it.</p><p>He took it to be a matter of pride.</p><p>It was a matter of pride.</p><p>He didn’t want to lose control.</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>He didn’t want to lose control.</p><p>He said, “I’m going to die alone.”</p><p>He didn’t want to go to the hospital.</p><p>“I’m going to die alone.”</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>“I’m going to die alone.”</p><p>I didn’t get it.</p><p>I didn’t get it.</p><p>I don’t believe him.</p><p>I don’t believe him.</p><p>I know he doesn’t.</p><p>You’re going to die alone.</p><p>I’m going to die alone.</p><p>No one’s going to care.</p><p>I’m going to die alone.</p><p>He didn’t know.</p><p>He didn’t know.</p><p>You don’t know.</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>“I’ll be coming back.”</p><p>I’ll be coming back.</p><p>I’ll be coming back.</p><p>He was going to the opera.</p><p>He was going to the opera.</p><p>He was going to the opera.</p><p>He was going to the opera.</p><p>He was going to the opera.</p><p>I will.</p><p>I will.</p><p>You don’t know anything.</p><p>I will.</p><p>I don’t know anything.</p><p>I will.</p><p>I will.</p><p>I will.</p><p>Don’t tell me!</p><p>Don’t tell me!</p><p>I’ll be back.</p><p>I’ll be back.</p><p>It will be over soon.</p><p>It will be over soon.</p><p>Oh, shit!</p><p>I’ll be back.</p><p>Don’t tell me!</p><p>I’ll be back.</p><p>I’ll be back.</p><p>I won’t be back.</p><p>Don’t tell me!</p><p>I’ll be back.</p><h2 id="human-prompt">Human Prompt</h2><p>Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms?
