Ultimate Fantasy 5</h2><h2 id="human-prompt">Human Prompt</h2><p>Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?</p><p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .</p><h2 id="computer-generated">Computer Generated</h2><p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, we had a band that played all-American folk songs. One night, our lead singer and I were getting into a car accidentally causing gas fumes to rise to the roof of the car, and the windshield blew off, throwing our singer out of the car, and down onto the highway.</p><p>Fortunately, he was okay.</p><p>Luckily for us, the highway was very winding.</p><p>Luckily for us, the highway was</p><p>turning right</p><p>Highway 101</p><p>The windshield blew off</p><p>I don’t know how many times I heard that,</p><p>The highway is for trucks</p><p>Turning right at this point</p><p>There are plenty of exits</p><p>At this location</p><p>At this location</p><p>You see, that’s how I imagined it</p><p>I don’t know how I found you</p><p>How do you know?</p><p>What do you do know?</p><p>Your family tree</p><p>Or do you know?</p><p>Know?</p><p>You’ve got the money to do it</p><p>Yeah, well I guess so. I have. So.</p><p>You said you had to have.</p><p>I didn’t.</p><p>I had to use someone else.</p><p>You didn’t.</p><p>I could’ve used you.</p><p>But you had to know.</p><p>So what’s new?</p><p>What’s wrong with me?</p><p>I know that sounds ridiculous.</p><p>“Hotline Miami” gave me chills.</p><p>Hotline Miami</p><p>I had to have it</p><p>I had to watch it</p><p>Oh come on! It’s not true!</p><p>It was the most exciting thing I’ve ever had the</p><p>It’s true!</p><p>It was the most exciting thing</p><p>I’m a grown man now.</p><p>It’s true!</p><p>It was the most exciting thing</p><p>I don’t even want to get into that</p><p>“Hotline Miami.”</p><p>Give me the straight answer.</p><p>Don’t give me that.</p><p>Let’s all just talk about what’s real right now.</p><p>Don’t give me any crap.</p><p>Okay. Let’s talk about what’s real now. Okay?</p><p>Let’s talk about money.</p><p>Don’t drag your Ex-Boyfriend into this.</p><p>What’s real about my life?</p><p>My ex-boyfriend</p><p>What’s real about your ex-boyfriend?</p><p>You’re dragging him into this.</p><p>He’s angry.</p><p>He’s jealous.</p><p>He’s needy.</p><p>He’s a faggot.</p><p>He needs you.</p><p>He’s a bimbo.</p><p>He’s straight.</p><p>He’s old-fashioned.</p><p>He wants to fuck you.</p><p>I don’t want to fuck him!</p><p>I want to fuck you.</p><p>But you said that it’s only because we broke up.</p><p>Don’t you even know how to kiss!</p><p>He said that he wanted to try new things.</p><p>That’s not true!</p><p>I want to fuck you but I don’t know how!</p><p>You said that you had ideas!</p><p>What did you have ideas about?!?!?!?!</p><p>What are you trying to pull?</p><p>I’m sorry, but there is one thing I do know for sure: money.</p><p>I can understand your need for money.</p><p>Well, you do know how to spend it.</p><p>And what do you know how to do with it?</p><p>Well, there is the “Affirmative Action” course.</p><p>Course you didn’t catch that one!</p><p>It’s the only course.</p><p>I just know you want to fuck me.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I just know that’s all you ever wanted.</p><p>I know that’s true.</p><p>Well, I guess I do now.</p><p>I know that you are.</p><p>But, but, but. But what about…</p><p>What are you getting at?</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>All right. All right.</p><p>What are you getting at?</p><p>You’re asking me to kiss a gay!</p><p>I’m asking you to help me move out of this apartment!</p><p>Then why do you want to kiss?</p><p>Because I don’t like him!</p><p>Then why do you want to keep him?</p><p>Because I don’t like the way things are going with him.</p><p>Then why do you want to keep him?</p><p>Because I don’t know how to get out of this!</p><p>How can you know what’s going to happen next?</p><p>Because you’re there!</p><p>And?</p><p>And?</p><p>Because I’m stupid!</p><p>You’re stupid!</p><p>All right. Well, go on.</p><p>What do you want to know?</p><p>I want to know if there’s any other roommates.</p><p>Yeah, well maybe we should look into that.</p><p>We haven’t looked into that, either.</p><p>Well, we might as well know now.</p><p>It’s a long shot.</p><p>So long!</p><p>I just hope that you’ll be patient.</p><p>You have my ear.</p><p>See, I don’t know if you’d let me move out on my own, but if you’d just listen to me and follow my directions…</p><p>That would be wonderful.</p><p>Thank you. I’ll sign the papers.</p><p>Oh, yeah. It’s okay. Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be alright. I know how you feel. It’s just that now I’m being watched. And it’s not just him. There’s the television. Too bright. And in the closet. This is very embarrassing. I’m not used to being watched in the bedroom. But there are mirrors and dresser drawers. And bookshelves. And leather. And silver screens. And little caddies in tiny little outfits. So what if it’s a little noisy. And there’s a slight breeze blowing outside. And dust. And flies. And the bedroom door is open and the lights are on. I could die. Or they could hear me. They’ve all moved upstairs. I don’t know why they’re here. I do. I can hear everything. And everything’s black.</p><p>Well, I wish you had said something.</p><p>It’s just a matter of time before he moves out.</p><p>He moved out just a few months ago.</p><p>I didn’t hear the move-in until last week.</p><p>It’s been three weeks.</p><p>It’s only been three weeks!</p><p>Now I’ve got a roommate who’s always on time, who’s never sick or missed a day, who’s a great dancer.</p><p>I know what you mean.</p><p>I know what you mean</p><p>I just wish you’d have said something!</p><p>She’s right.</p><p>I didn’t say anything.</p><p>It’s okay. I’m just a roommate and all that. It’s nothing. But it’s not okay. I don’t know what to do. Do you know what to do?</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>I just hoped that if you were patient, I would be able to find a suitable roommate.</p><p>I think I already have.</p><p>Well, I know who you are. I know that you are a homosexual. I just happen to know that you are not. But you know that I know what it feels like to be watched and to have my dignity insulted. I don’t know what to do.</p><p>I don’t know what to do!</p><p>I’m sorry, but I just don’t know what to do.</p><p>How can you know what’s going on in my head? I have no idea. I can think about it all, but I’m not sure I can bring myself to say it out loud.</p><p>I can always tell what it feels like to be watched.</p><p>I know what it feels like to be touched. I know what it feels like to be touched in a way that makes your heart leap. I know what it feels like to have someone put their arm around your waist and pull it close. I know what it feels like to have someone put a pillow around your neck and try to kiss you. I can even imagine what it feels like to be slapped and to be nuzzled against a wall. Maybe it feels so real. Or maybe it’s not.</p><p>So?</p><p>We don’t know. I guess we don’t know, either.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>What you mean is that I don’t know?</p><p>That’s not what I mean.</p><p>Just say it.</p><p>That’s what I want.</p><p>It’s not what I want.</p><p>I’m not sure it is.</p><p>Okay. Now, we’ll say your name out loud.</p><p>Say it. Say it loud and clear.</p><p>That’s okay. I’m a lot louder than you are.</p><p>I’m a lot less sure.</p><p>Now, I’ll bet you can guess who it is.</p><p>I can guess.</p><p>I can guess a lot.</p><p>Alright. I’m A, B, and… C. Now let’s say you’re A. Now say you’re a blow-up doll. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary breasts. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary balls. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary fingers. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary hair. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary ears. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary eyes. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary legs. Now say you’re a blow-up doll with imaginary feet.</p><p>Alright. I’m a lot more of an A than you are.</p><p>Now say you’re a mop.</p><p>Alright.</p><h2 id="corpus">Corpus</h2><ul><li><a href="/queerai">Queer AI</a></li><li>Training Step 1250</li><li>Perplexity 98.11</li></ul><h2 id="credits">Credits</h2><p>Prompt adapted from <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/feb/19/queer-computing-1/">A Queer History of Computing</a></p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2020-09-18T00:00:00-07:00">September 18, 2020</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/machine learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="/tag/GPT-2">GPT-2</a>, <a href="/tag/RunwayML">RunwayML</a>, <a href="/tag/queer">queer</a>, <a href="/tag/Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="/tag/folk song">folk song</a>, <a href="/tag/blow-up doll">blow-up doll</a>, <a href="/tag/mop">mop</a></span></section></main></body></html>
