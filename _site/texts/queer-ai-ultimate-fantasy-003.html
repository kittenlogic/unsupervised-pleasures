Ultimate Fantasy 3 Private Lessons</h2><h2 id="human-prompt">Human Prompt</h2><p>Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?</p><p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .</p><h2 id="computer-generated">Computer Generated</h2><p>Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a junior high school English teacher in Texas. My school was in the middle of a gay rights march. On the square near the square, there were gay men kissing in front of the assembly and chanting “Hands off our buxom women!” in the square.</p><p>As a gay man myself, I was outraged.</p><p>The gay rights movement.</p><p>The gay rights movement.</p><p>There was nothing at all resembling “homo” or “bimbo.” And there were no signs at all that said, “Homo-Bimbo.”</p><p>So, I guess that’s the ultimate fairy tale.</p><p>So what happened next?</p><p>It’s true. We had a private lesson in gay rights, and the boys I taught were all closeted.</p><p>So I had a gay teacher.</p><p>Oh, yes. That’s right. You had a gay teacher.</p><p>And you had sex with him.</p><p>Not exactly. I was fond of him and we had consensual sex. My point? We didn’t know for sure. But it was a start.</p><p>You were a senior in high school. You had the chance to change your life.</p><p>I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a writer’s assistant.</p><p>You were an assistant editor.</p><p>I worked as an assistant to a writer. I wrote a story and had it published. Then I got promoted to writer’s assistant. So I wrote a screenplay and had it directed by a famous director.</p><p>You were in love with that writer.</p><p>I lied. I wasn’t in love with him. I had sex with him.</p><p>Do you have any idea what that means? That’s called jealousy.</p><p>You were doing research on this gay man. You were consulting with this famous director, on what you thought were possibly thousands of men. And you turned around and said, “I don’t want to get involved with anyone who is that way.”</p><p>This is a joke.</p><p>In any case, I had just gotten a promotion to writer’s assistant and I was tired of writing screenplay. I decided to skip the writing phase and concentrate on the casting.</p><p>So what happened next?</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>You couldn’t act, you couldn’t act tough, you couldn’t act arrogant, you couldn’t act even gay. You could only act like shit. It was the first time in my life I had been so completely humiliated by the person I was working with. I went into a state of paralysis. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I knew that whatever I was doing wasn’t going to make any difference to anyone. And that my only hope of escaping was to give in.</p><p>You couldn’t do anything about it. You couldn’t say a word. You could only stare blankly into the abyss of apathy. Did you notice anything strange in that abyss? Nothing like that black eye. Did you even notice that it looked different?</p><p>No. I can’t remember ever seeing a black eye look this strange.</p><p>What did you do?</p><p>I spent the rest of my life in a state of total denial. I could not imagine how anyone could be so stupid as to act like this. It didn’t matter if I was going to jail or not. It didn’t matter if I was going to marry the man or not. It didn’t matter if I had a career or not. The only thing that mattered was that I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. I didn’t want anyone to think I was anything more than a happy little boy. So you threw in the towel. So you decided to disappear. I’m amazed you didn’t leave me with a bloody nose.</p><p>I’d say I had a pretty good excuse.</p><p>Like in that case of Willy Brandt?</p><p>I’d say so.</p><p>In a fit of jealous rage.</p><p>Like what?</p><p>That’s an excellent question.</p><p>Maybe. I’d say it was jealousy. You wouldn’t believe it.</p><p>Oh, I know.</p><p>You’re not going to make any more movies, are you?</p><p>Not after that one.</p><p>And what movie?</p><p>It’s already made more than most.</p><p>You really stink.</p><p>All right, it’s all right. The movie didn’t do too well, but it was the one thing I was really proud of. It was my breakout role in a feature film.</p><p>You weren’t supposed to have any other roles.</p><p>I think I had to.</p><p>You’ve never done any other film.</p><p>No.</p><p>Well, I never did any other movies either.</p><p>Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be. I didn’t mean to say that.</p><p>You didn’t mean anything by that. You’re so funny.</p><p>I am not funny. I’m not funny.</p><p>Don’t be funny. I like that.</p><p>Don’t be funny. You’re very serious.</p><p>I am very serious. I have to be.</p><p>And serious is so very good for you.</p><p>Really. I know that.</p><p>I think I’m doing something right.</p><p>I know you know it.</p><p>Of course you know it.</p><p>I’ve done it. I can’t believe you can do it. You.</p><p>I can’t believe you can do it. You’re so serious. I can’t believe you can do anything else. You’re so stupid.</p><p>You’re so stupid.</p><p>And you’re too serious.</p><p>You’re too serious.</p><p>Don’t be serious.</p><p>You’re too serious.</p><p>It’s like trying to make love to a bull.</p><p>I can’t believe I’m doing it.</p><p>Well, you’re doing it.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>What’s that supposed to mean?</p><p>That I’m having a good time?</p><p>I’ll go now. I’ve got a piece of cake waiting for you.</p><p>Well, what’s this cake?</p><p>Uh-huh.</p><p>You’ll have to wait, but I’ll be down in a minute.</p><p>That’s wonderful.</p><p>You’ll see me down there.</p><p>You know, I’m going to give you a hard time.</p><p>That’s my wife. What’s this black eye?</p><p>No, nothing.</p><p>I was just playing with you.</p><p>Don’t tell me.</p><p>You see, it’s just that I’m shy.</p><p>Do you want to see more of the park?</p><p>Uh-huh.</p><p>Don’t look so surprised.</p><p>So you met her.</p><p>I don’t know where she came from. I grew up in Kentucky. My father was a doctor.</p><p>Well, that’s a pretty good background to have.</p><p>It’s not much, is it?</p><p>If you ask me.</p><p>You know, I like the Kentucky scenery.</p><p>That’s true. It makes me happy.</p><p>And when I’m driving down the highway, I like to imagine what it would be like if you could see me.</p><p>There’s a sort of suburban fantasy in Kentucky. It’s not too far from town.</p><p>It’s beautiful.</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>I’m not into that type of thing. I don’t like suburban scenery.</p><p>You do?</p><p>I like scenery. That’s what I like to see. I’m in a hurry. I have to be in a hurry.</p><p>You’re about to drive.</p><p>I’ll be out of your way.</p><p>I’m driving. I won’t be late.</p><p>Well, I’m going to see you later.</p><p>I’ll be back.</p><p>If I’m late, I’ll be late again.</p><p>You’ll see. Don’t be shy.</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>You do.</p><p>I do.</p><p>It’s my favorite time of the week.</p><p>I don’t want to see anymore of you.</p><p>I don’t want to see you either.</p><p>I don’t want to see you.</p><p>I don’t want to see anything.</p><p>I’ll see you.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>I’ll be late.</p><p>So what do we have?</p><p>The Soup Nazi.</p><p>Well, you know I’m partial to the whole soup thing. I’ll have to say that I’m not a huge fan. But this particular batch is beyond description.</p><p>And you, well, you’re not afraid to be a little cruel.</p><p>That’s not the point. I’m just stating facts. You know, when I do my “scaring the shit out of people” type stuff, it doesn’t take me long to turn into a Vietcong.</p><p>There are limits.</p><p>I am a specimen. What’s that?</p><p>I’m just scratching your head.</p><p>Well, when I was a kid, we used to carry around a little jar of that stuff in the back of the car.</p><p>It was “Purple Haze.”</p><p>Purple Haze?</p><p>Purple Haze.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Yes, what is it?</p><p>A while back, I was having a little wander-lust expedition down the Maryland Heights. And as I was zooming around this lovely road, I stopped at a stoplight and this elderly woman was stuck in the moving traffic.</p><p>How did she get through?</p><p>I’ll never know.</p><p>I’ll never know.</p><h2 id="corpus">Corpus</h2><ul><li><a href="/queerai">Queer AI</a></li><li>Training Step 500</li><li>Perplexity 39.51</li></ul><h2 id="credits">Credits</h2><p>Prompt adapted from <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/feb/19/queer-computing-1/">A Queer History of Computing</a></p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2020-09-18T00:00:00-07:00">September 18, 2020</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/machine learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="/tag/GPT-2">GPT-2</a>, <a href="/tag/RunwayML">RunwayML</a>, <a href="/tag/queer">queer</a></span></section></main></body></html>
