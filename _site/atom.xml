   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Gay cruising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s that? Oh, cruising! Queer cruising. I adore it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine meeting other queer people for the first time, going to a gay bar on Friday night, cruising the gayborhood all night, then cruising the following Saturday night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How romantic!&lt;br /&gt;
What would we eat? What would we do?&lt;br /&gt;
How many alcoholic drinks will we consume?&lt;br /&gt;
Will there be blow jobs?&lt;br /&gt;
Can we make love in public places?&lt;br /&gt;
Is there the possibility of bodily harm?&lt;br /&gt;
If we do it in public, will there be angry mob action?&lt;br /&gt;
Queer sex workers.&lt;br /&gt;
Are there bisexual sex workers?&lt;br /&gt;
What about intersex sex workers?&lt;br /&gt;
Are there people with multiple sex partners?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love to imagine the wild and crazy, the wild and crazy nights! But there has to be a balance. We can’t just take the wild and crazy and run with it. There has to be a careful balance.
There has to be an emotional center. Romance has to be based in truth. There has to be. Trust, respect, and affection have to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about this… Let’s say we’re a couple and we go out to a bar on a Friday night. Friday is gayborhood time. There’s a big line at the front. People are queuing up behind the counter and waiting to get into the gayborhood. Suddenly there’s this gorgeous young man, just comes out of the bathroom naked, and he’s just staring straight into our eyes. And he’s got these big round eyes and he’s got this Wow! What an amazing body!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what they say, if it has wings, it’s a bird. His eyes are blue, like two balloons stuck together. His hands are covered in glitter. His feet are covered in glitter. His arms are covered in glitter. His mouth is covered in glitter. His tongue is glitter. His feet are covered in glitter. His hands are covered in sparkly glitter. His hair is silver. His hair is wild and curly and beautiful and it’s blowing in all directions. All night long people are staring and people are taking photos and people are taking videos. Say what you want about this young American gentleman. He just came out of the bathroom naked and he’s staring straight into our beautiful eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could disappear.
You mean disappear?
I could disappear right in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;
There’s a painting by Paul Cadmus at the top of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you very much. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;
What was it about?&lt;br /&gt;
The Crucifixion. I think.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. That’s it. The Crucifixion. The bloody Crucifixion.&lt;br /&gt;
What does it mean to be young again?&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Yes. It’s important.&lt;br /&gt;
What is it like to have the most vile human being in the world as your lover?&lt;br /&gt;
I want to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;
How many times can you do that? How many orgasms can you hold in one go?&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus Christ. One more.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you know what you want?&lt;br /&gt;
I want a cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;
You want to be fucked.&lt;br /&gt;
Done.&lt;br /&gt;
How often do you want it?&lt;br /&gt;
Once a week?&lt;br /&gt;
Once a month?&lt;br /&gt;
Once a week or every two weeks?&lt;br /&gt;
How often do you want it in your mouth?&lt;br /&gt;
How many orgasms can you make in one second?&lt;br /&gt;
How many strokes can one hand hold?&lt;br /&gt;
One minute, two minutes, five minutes…&lt;br /&gt;
Is it painful?&lt;br /&gt;
Does it make you horny?&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes I’m stone hard and sometimes I’m oozing wet passion.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you like it?&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not sure yet.&lt;br /&gt;
Tell me about it.&lt;br /&gt;
You like it when I give myself a break.&lt;br /&gt;
And you have to make do.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve given myself a break. I don’t think I can last more than a few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
Very good.&lt;br /&gt;
The pain is… so… oh God… is so… oh God… do I look like shit?&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
Fuck it.&lt;br /&gt;
We are protected by a piss-can factory.&lt;br /&gt;
But it’s good.&lt;br /&gt;
Hug me.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Yes.&lt;br /&gt;
Come here and put your hand in.&lt;br /&gt;
Can I get you a drink?&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Yes. I want tea.&lt;br /&gt;
Coffee?&lt;br /&gt;
And I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you. Queer bastard.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 60 Gay Tony Soprano</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. A fantasy in which queers never existed. What if queers never existed? In which the experience of queer sex was as exotic, reducible, and downright criminal as any other kind of sex work. In which johns and girls in leather suits took turns fucking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queers are no longer a crime. We have the right to exist. We can protest, we can lobby, we can walk the streets, we can adopt a child, we can wed, we can fuck in public, we can love in private, we can bleed out on the streets. But we mustn’t become martyrs, like Che Guevara. We mustn’t become Haskins. We mustn’t become deserters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one more minute. I want you to fingerbang him. I want you to rough me up. I want you to pleasure yourself while I scream. Ah, fuck it! Let’s stop fetishizing violence. Hit him, slap him, pull his hair, bite his face, gouge out his eyesocket, nose, ears, genitals, whatever it is he wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now see this. If we screw up big time, there won’t be a funeral. We’ll be left alone. No one will talk about it. And no one will care. They’ll think we lost a son, that he was a lost cause. No one will say, he was a failure. He may as well have been a Gay Tony Soprano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that now I’m being watched. And it’s not just him. There’s the television. Too bright. And in the closet. This is very embarrassing. I’m not used to being watched in the bedroom. But there are mirrors and dresser drawers. And bookshelves. And leather. And silver screens. And little caddies in tiny little outfits. So what if it’s a little noisy. And there’s a slight breeze blowing outside. And dust. And flies. And the bedroom door is open and the lights are on. I could die. Or they could hear me. They’ve all moved upstairs. I don’t know why they’re here. I do. I can hear everything. And everything’s black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I know who you are. I know that you are a homosexual. And you know that I know what it feels like to be watched and to have my dignity insulted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can always tell what it feels like to be watched. I know what it feels like to be touched. I know what it feels like to be touched in a way that makes your heart leap. I know what it feels like to have someone put their arm around your waist and pull it close. I know what it feels like to have someone put a pillow around your neck and try to kiss you. I can even imagine what it feels like to be slapped and to be nuzzled against a wall. Maybe it feels so real. Or maybe it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Do you love me?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you love me inside?&lt;br /&gt;
Kiss me. Feel me.&lt;br /&gt;
It feels so good doesn’t it?&lt;br /&gt; Feeling your body against mine.&lt;br /&gt;
You like that don’t you?&lt;br /&gt; Some of my best sex.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you want to keep going?&lt;br /&gt;
Want to share something?&lt;br /&gt; We can share our clothes.&lt;br /&gt; Or our beds.&lt;br /&gt; We can share our dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
I dreamt that tonight my bedroom door was open and two black-clad figures stood inside, one in front, holding hands.&lt;br /&gt; I was so turned on I nearly lost control.&lt;br /&gt; I ran screaming from the bedroom door.&lt;br /&gt; Screaming like a lion.&lt;br /&gt; I ran so fast I nearly knocked over the doorknob.&lt;br /&gt; My friends watched in horror.&lt;br /&gt; I ran so fast they couldn’t follow.&lt;br /&gt; Finally I ran out of the house on my hands and knees, a callous fucker.&lt;br /&gt;
What are you hiding from me?&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t you remember?&lt;br /&gt;
Touch me, baby. Tell me everything.&lt;br /&gt; Do I look sexy in purple? Orange? Auburn?&lt;br /&gt; Bold. Curly. Tit. Round. Round. Round. Soft. Hard. Tit! Ass.&lt;br /&gt; Round ass, ass up, ass down.&lt;br /&gt;
Cover me in cling-film.&lt;br /&gt;
Yesoooh!&lt;br /&gt; It’s so humiliating, I thought I was hallucinating.&lt;br /&gt; I covered myself in clingfilm so I wouldn’t be recognized.&lt;br /&gt; Now you’ll see.&lt;br /&gt; I have no suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt; I’m covered in clingfilm to keep me warm at night.&lt;br /&gt; Because today I had a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;
My idealized idealized sexual partner.&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine me. My lover.&lt;br /&gt;
Me and you in the Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;
We meet in a bar.&lt;br /&gt;
We go to a gay bar.&lt;br /&gt;
And I fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orgasm&lt;br /&gt;
After&lt;br /&gt;
We have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orgasm&lt;br /&gt;

Kissing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orgasm&lt;br /&gt;

I fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, really.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe we do.&lt;br /&gt;
Wait, let me think.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe we don’t.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the fuck you want to call it, I fell in love with you the way you wanted me to, the way you said you wanted me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three days I could tell you were falling in love, but the love never stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My love never stopped either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My skin crawled all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally did go to the hospital I told them I had AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still love me, love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was in the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always been my dream to have my very own private lesbian bar. The only problem is, there aren’t any bars in this town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, there are bars! Such as in Atlanta and San Francisco, where Queer Rebels meets every third Thursday. And in New York City, we are soon to have our very own dedicated lesbian karaoke night club, Les Belle Journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles there’s the now-defunct ymag, and soon-to-be-defunct Dyke March. Meanwhile in San Francisco, the long-vacant Golden Gate Park is home to The Village Lesbian Comedy Theater, a weekly, all-ages stand-up club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for my very own dedicated queer cabaret club. My very own dedicated queer karaoke night club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the hell are these other queer bars? You all think they’re great. I could never get into any of these bars in my wild youth. Where are the other queer cabarets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I waited in a cab for my turn, passing gay bars and clubs that were as gay as the day they were created, I could hear the conversation going on in my cab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooh, newscaster impressions! Queer Prophet is opening its office in a gayborhood!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school my best friend and I made love in a school bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend and I were both in the same honors college and had just begun getting serious about getting married. Prior to that, we had only it done once, in a dorm room, and it was amazing. We got wild and had a lot of sex, and we were beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I didn’t realize just how much I missed having complete control over my own sex life. We never even told each other’s names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now I don’t know how we held our sexual freedom. We loved each other, but not the way most people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in love with a very attractive young man. Prior had a lot of money. Prior and I were very good friends. Prior was a very rich man. Prior had a whole fleet of expensive cars. Prior was a very powerful man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cars, the parties, the sexual conquests. It was all so exciting, and yet I was terrified. I felt as though I was running scared at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that romantic high flying, and there I was i lying next to him on the bed, doing bear hug, when all of a sudden he says, Don’t worry about it, I’m not into that kinda stuff. Don’t rush an artist. I can’t believe he actually said that. My jaw dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around for anyone else to comfort me but none of them would listen. I began to cry. Finally, someone from my dorm said, You know those guys at work used to give you a hard time just for being queer? Well, they’re going to give you another hard time this year if you don’t get out of line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn’t take long to figure out that this was no ordinary college buddy comedy. A bunch of our theater friends were having a bar-b-que, pretending to be gay. Actually, it was more of a bathhouse comedy pitting two gay high school students against one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. A friend of Harvey’s has this cabin on a steep hill overlooking the Willamette River. The fire is still burning and the smell is unbearable. He tells me he has a “dream” this weekend in which he thinks he is in “The Pit.” I ask him what it is he imagines himself doing there. He tells me he envisions himself leading a normal, middle-class existence. Then, he tells me, suddenly he senses something terrifying and insists I get out of bed. He says he has been taking hallucinogenic drugs lately, such as Valium and Valium + Lysergic acid diethylamide. He says he dreams of swimming through rapids, of tigers and lions, of armies marching on fields. Lunatic fringe orchard. A quiet place for the weekend. June.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-051</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Kentucky. My father was a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s a pretty good background to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not much, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I like the Kentucky scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s true. It makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I’m driving down the highway, I like to imagine what it would be like if you could see me. There’s a sort of suburban fantasy in Kentucky. It’s not too far from town. It’s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not into that type of thing. I don’t like suburban scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like scenery. That’s what I like to see. I’m in a hurry. I have to be in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re about to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be my guest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new convertible. It’s got heated front seats, power windows, leather upholstery, power sunroof, moonroof… and a 5.2-speakers, big-screen surround sound, and a six-point sun map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And heated sunroof and moonroof and 4-wheel drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to have an affair with this beautiful lady. My fantasies are not limited to your country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just going to say… I like the look of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Tamed. Comfortable. Smart. Not demanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not demanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just going to say… I could care less if you’re black, gay, brown, or whatever your assigned sex at school is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be firm. I’m not here to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a sexologist. My name is Dr. Ben Carson. I have done thousands of studies on human sexuality. And I can tell you from personal experience that the vast majority of men and women who find satisfaction in sex, desire it the same way you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they do. Maybe they don’t. But whatever the reason, most men and most women are far from satisfied with their sex lives. They want more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want more than that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “want more than that.” This attitude is repellent to millions of men and women who want to be loved, safe, and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never asked you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would you have done if I had asked you? You would have told me to fuck off. I wouldn’t have, wouldn’t I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you want me to fuck you anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s the kind of guy you are. You are repulsive to me. You are repulsive to me because…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not repulsive to you. You are repulsive to me because you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t get past that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see? It’s like that. It goes with the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll notice, I’m not finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may ask a question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you ever…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in a garden party and I went down and met an old man who was dying of cancer. He was very kind to me and he was asking me how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: “Goodbye, darling, you are much prettier now than you were at the party.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know what a garden party was. I thought it was just a party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would he come down and meet you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, he said: “I must tell you that I am very sad, and that is the best way I can express my feelings. I am on my death bed. I don’t know if I can live anymore. And, for my part, I must tell you that I am sorry.” I said: “Yes, I understand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did he say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very sorry. It seems that I have lost my voice. I am so sorry. I hope I never lose it again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Goodbye, darling. It is my last time with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s terrible, isn’t it?&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God. What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sea.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea is the mother of all disasters.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea is God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. It’s just a metaphor.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s like living on the moon.&lt;br /&gt;
Lumen, illuminate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to talk about the sea now.&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t imagine what it must be like on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s why I’m here. It’s so clear. I love it here.&lt;br /&gt; There’s no one else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:2em 0;padding:100% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/648204782?h=99c2b4448c&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;moon-queer-vulvic-volumetric&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moon is the mother of all the gods.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s a lie.&lt;br /&gt;
I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not even sure I believe what I’m saying.&lt;br /&gt;
I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
You have to let them know that you love them.&lt;br /&gt;
I love them. I do. I do. I do.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s really wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s just so overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s impossible.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s okay.&lt;br /&gt;
I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God. I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not sure I believe what I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s really too clear.&lt;br /&gt;
I think I love you, too.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s the moon.&lt;br /&gt;
I think I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
We have to find a way to express love.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
I feel… nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 48 The Perfect Plot</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody in the theater says it has the perfect plot. But I can tell you from my own experience that there are many, MANY more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaningless platitudes and preachers on TV bring no joy to anyone, let alone the people you love. We need to find something real in the ordinary, the commonplace, the commonplace that’s exceptional. We have to let go of what we don’t understand, or don’t want to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idyllic music, breath taking lighting, and fountains of colored lights will bring everyone to a stand still and soak up the ambiance. Then everyone will dance and shout and hug and pray and cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be quiet. I’m sure I’m interrupting just before my very eyes the moment a perfectly ordinary high school senior kisses a beautiful redhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Heaven were a movie, Id love to see how they handled the love triangle. Would they twist the knife and sacrifice Tom Cruise so they wouldn’t have to cast their hearts into that proverbial garden?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory goes something like this. On one end we have the good Christian boy whose heart is always in the right place. On the other we have the Beast, filthy little queer wanted by every grade school principal with a hankie for big hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icks! Shell shock! It’s all too much to hope for in the face of temptation. So what do we do? Build a wall, knock the shit out of each other, raise hell, take out shotguns, gut cows, and start killing the shit inside each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I guess I just have to get used to the feeling that most of what I believe in is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit? I have no need for it! Keep out of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you trying to convert me, Tom? Do you ever think maybe I could be…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idolatry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, you lost me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve, my dear, in large part on your ability to let go of the things you don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a wonderful feature of the English language… they can say just about anything and it’s perfectly acceptable. I’m still not used to the idea that I owe my life to anybody but myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greek tragedy, tragedy, fuckin’ tragedy. Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover is gay and I want him to sleep with other men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is he bisexual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover is straight and I want him to sleep with women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is he tomboy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover is tomboy and I want him to sleep with girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is he a lesbian?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover is tomboy and I want him to sleep with boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive narrowed it down to three broad broad groups:
Biphobia.
Lesbianism.
Androgyny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I go through these please think of the people you didn’t even know were queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My queer friend may be bisexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My queer friend may be tomboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My queer friend may be tomboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I would love to have known!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biphobia. Biphobia is when a person’s attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on stereotypes, stereotypes that are not based on reality. For example, some people think that if they are gay they cant get laid because they’re too feminine. This is called the Biphobia effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Ive narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orphobia. Orphobia is when a person’s attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on the idea of the sacred or sacred gender. For example, some people think that if they are priests they cant get laid because they’re too masculine. This is called the Orphobia effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Ive narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orphobia and Androphobia. Orphobia and Androphobia are usually in conflict. For example, some people may have very strong or very weak attraction to both men and women. Orphobia can also lead to the idea that a person may or may not be gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Ive narrowed it down to three broad groups and Im starting from from there. Biphobia. Biphobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover may be bisexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover may be tomboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover may be tomboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own personal faggot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My lover and I have been lovers for many years. He is a doctor. I admire his precision. I want to work with him on a large project. His specialty is bone marrow. We have many years together, many children. We have a home, a life together. But something happens that changes everything. He leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not suddenly; rather slowly over many months, years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Wait, I want to go back to the house where we first met. I want to go back to the moment that made me want to lose myself. I want to go back to that week in March, when the phone rang, the appointment set, and the motherly words, “Baby, it’s Tuesday!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the moment the beautiful woman on the phone asked me if I was gay. My heart skipped a beat at the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the moment the beautiful woman on the phone put her arm around me and said, “Can I get you anything, sweetheart?” My heart skipped a beat again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the moment the motherly words, “I love you,” filled my heart and sent me dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get to be president of the United States…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to put an X on that card and shove it up your nose. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get elected…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to have one of your senators tattoo my bicep with the words: “I Love Barrett’s Ass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get elected, I am going to eliminate the F.B.I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first act will be to sign a bill making it a crime to aid any foreign power in resisting American domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to end sex education in our public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first act will be to eliminate the F.B.I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the Human Rights Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the American Humanist Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. We have one less voting bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sumba! We have won!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 44 Born This Way</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-044"/>
   <updated>2021-03-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-044</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I Was Born This Way. Noted workhorse of the gay liberation movement, author of Every Little Girl a River, and the mother of Stonewall Jane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. The life of Stonewall Jane. The story of how a bunch of dykes from the Lower East Side of Manhattan came together to create a gay women’s organization whose mission statement read: “A pure, unadulterated, non-committed, non-homoerotic, non-monogamy organization dedicated to the improvement of the human sex and to the organization of sex education in schools.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty Cochrane. The name stuck. We knew it. We incorporated in the same year that Laurel and I came out. We started doing face-to-face meetings to sort of hammer out our differences. And we loved each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, I was a little afraid that if I came out, that my relationships with men would be put under a bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of research that suggests that being gay does in fact make you more homophobic, and that a great many gay men are still homophobic. And that some of those men are probably still in abusive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be real, Laurel, and we were not going to play by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would have been ostracized from my friends. Laurel, Cathy, I have a confession to make. I was wrong about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of the hostility I’ve seen toward people who are gay comes from two places. One is from people who want us as we are. The other is from people who think that because we do things that are different from their way of life that somehow we’re somehow lesser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s such a frightening thing to think about, Kitty, because we could all be dead. So, Kitty, I’ll ask you this another way. How many gay men are in abusive relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re being silly. Do you have any idea how many men I’ve known who would sleep with me and be faithful to me no matter what? I have slept with hundreds. I have slept with thousands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just how many straight men do you know who cheat on their wives? I’m not asking you to give me any statistics, Kitty. But you would know, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping with other men has nothing whatsoever to do with a man being a good father. And the myth that men who cheat on their wives are somehow “disingenuous,” as one friend put it, flies in the face of all the hard science on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you’re upset that we didn’t get along, but I want you to remember one thing: Laurel and I were best friends. We had our differences, and we hung in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 43 Libertine Saint Theresa</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be a Saint Theresa of the Immaculate Conception! Libertine Saint Theresa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mean you’d rather die than fuck a faggot? Then pick up a book and study the gay life in America. Look at the commercials for birth control, the doctor shopping, and the endless commercials for condoms. And what are we left with? Chopped liver, aching muscles, joint pain, and, God forbid, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cancer is preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A healthy age for men to have sex is between the ages of 18 and 24.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Condoms prevent AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop telling me what I can and can’t do! I want to be free to love and be myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’d still rather have a faggot as your lover than a saint like me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will, baby! You’re so fucked! What’s the matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will, baby! Just take it away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! I nearly died. I thought I’d die the way so many other closeted faggots do. A bullet would have stopped me. But I had Saint Theresa and the bullet didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will. Now stop giving me a faggot’s pittance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want more? I love a real relationship, where you can be yourself and I can be you. No more gay porno!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate all that gay crap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porn is bad for your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive been tested negative for Viagra, and they give you a hard time getting it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never told me about your erectile dysfunction shots!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ve never even told you about my life with a man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a faggot’s pittance, just like I want a faggot’s life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive had enough of this discussion. Get out of my room. You want Saint Theresa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will, baby! I want to die!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It has nothing to do with Blue Cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for real. I want you to imagine how I would feel if you were a man and I were a woman. Imagine kissing, holding hands, doing intimate body poses. How would we feel? How could we love? How could we live our lives? What would our fantasies be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to have you follow me home from the store and spend the night like we used to. We’d take turns kneeling in the dark, covering each other with our arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I turned hostile and said, “I don’t want to see you anymore” and you had to fight me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would our fantasies be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see you walk down the street alone at night, your breasts swaying as you pass men on the street. I’d love to see the look in your eye as you turned and flashed that “I do”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He takes her to his place. She takes the elevator up. He goes through the bedroom door. She becomes aware of LIL J. They kiss. He goes into the bathroom. She becomes aware of JOSHUA. They embrace. They go into the bedroom. She becomes aware of KITTY. She removes her hand from JOSHUA’s neck. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She pulls her pants up. She becomes aware of RITA. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She pulls her pants up. She becomes aware of JOSHUA. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She becomes aware of KITTY. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She becomes aware of RITA. She lies down on the bed. She pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lil and Joshua have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lil J awakens at 4 a.m. to a phone call from KITTY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could have kept you, honey. I miss you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gave your life to make someone else feel better. That is what true love is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad you feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more phone sex please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A phone sex alert?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would ever want a Larry Merchant-sized dick in their mouth after that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May I have the number?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number is a bonus on my next book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May I use it please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I mean, hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. Great. So how’d you do last night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do very well. I don’t usually hang around bars after dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s okay. So, tell me about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a writer. Just not very good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what drew you to the theater?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a shrink once. He was a playwright I knew and trusted. And I figured if I could get laid free of his yokel bullshit, maybe I could write my own book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not your book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No! Look, I just remembered I have to be up front with Kitty about what I do. I’m not the straight woman you think I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then act like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Act like Kitty. You know I won’t lie to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty would be proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not if it meant telling her about me fucking a shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine me doing that to my wife?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t you tell me that you and Kitty hooked up on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because… well, because, that’s how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a great way to start a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe we could go on a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. If I could have one wish come true today, it would be that you would fuck me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe you. I am so very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No you’re not. But just fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUCK ME! FUUUUUUUCK ME! BLOW J’EM OUT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUCK ME! FUUUUUCK ME!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know me too well. I know how much you love me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you too much to give you up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care! Fucking would be one thing. Threeways is another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking might change things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not. But fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something I can do?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Not that I’m exaggerating when I say it’s a gay communal fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, how about this. . . one night, maybe in Miami Beach, Florida, Or in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, buddy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe in Detroit, MI. You get the picture. The ultimate in communal fantasy could be in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I love it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hated by most of my friends, despised by my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I love queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if it’s not gay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t know anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t know anything about love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not accepting of any kind of love of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you suppose it is that makes me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queers love more than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I don’t know. I guess it’s our nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if that’s the case, why don’t we just call each other by our first names, like we used to do in elementary school? Like we used to do when we first met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t even joke about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all seem to be drawn to strong, masculine Omigod… it’s so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omigod! How could you resist me? Let’s just say you’re attracted to men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s crazy talk, sweetheart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say you fall somewhere in the “Not Straight” or “Not Gay” spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just happen to fall somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you said attraction doesn’t have to be based on sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell was that about? I said it has nothing to do with sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what you said all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never said anything about not being attracted to men. I just said it has nothing to do with sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think I’m “acting gay,” not realizing that your bait-fish is a sex symbol transformed into a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s ridiculous. You said you just assumed I was straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t think I assumed it based on sex, but on your very own words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t think I “asked” you. I “asked” him… to come over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to start acting funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just trying to help you understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you invited me over just so you could brag to me about how you “converted” him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t “convert” him. I “healed” him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You “healed.” Oh, that’s another word for “reformed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re going to tell me how it changed you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t think I could have been happy with Harvey if I hadn’t tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had every intention of turning your life around. All you had to do was follow my suggestions and you’d be straight again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What “suggestions” did I “suggestion” you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, you absolutely insisted that I get tested for STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You CONFUSED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it’s not funny. You just said I “asked” you to come over. That’s ridiculous…. Because whatever you may have thought about our relationship, you never asked me to come over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn’t I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, did you. And that’s just what’s “confused.” You “asked.” You CONFUSED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s new?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve certainly confused me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything between us that you don’t KNOW is homosexual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please! There are lots of areas where we MAY be. I just haven’t been exposed to them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you may be right about that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the life of me, I can’t fathom how you could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t “convert” you just because you asked me over. I wouldn’t “ask” anyone just because they asked me. It just doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could it if you’re just trying to say that I’m gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm… maybe it is… just not me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a moment to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do you go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I love a man who has nothing to do with me, is not in love with me, is not even in the romantic category. He’s just plain gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He takes no crap from me. He doesn’t call me all the time to see how I am. He’s never made more than a passing remark about my haircut or the color of my eyes. He’s not interested in our child-rearing or our falling in love. He’s simply there for me when I’m at my best and when I need him most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s not interested in our personal romances or our painful but ultimately fulfilling gay sex. He simply is… plain… gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It may not be what you want either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a unicorn.&lt;br /&gt;
Or a hoofed gnome.&lt;br /&gt;
Or a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;
Or a unicorn mare.&lt;br /&gt;
Or a home run battering ram.&lt;br /&gt;
Or a water buffalo.&lt;br /&gt;
Or both at once.&lt;br /&gt;
Or none of these at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it a gay love story. A love story between men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could die.&lt;br /&gt;
I could fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;
I could be disowned by my family.&lt;br /&gt;
I could go to jail.&lt;br /&gt;
I could be in love with a woman.&lt;br /&gt;
I could leave my wife and kids for a man.&lt;br /&gt;
Or none of these at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no wrong answers. In life we make mistakes. We build on them. Love conquers all. Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 36 Safe Sex</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-036"/>
   <updated>2020-12-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-036</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover is bisexual and we love each other. He has two wives. One of them he calls mistress and the other he calls girlfriend. They sleep together in their house and he picks up the checkbook at the Post Office. Then he goes to work and leaves the money for the mistress. When he arrives home, he sorts the checkbooks and returns the money to the wives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like what you’re saying. I think of that wonderful American tradition of giving and giving and giving. We give without expecting anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve never been intimate with anyone before, have you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then what do you know about safe sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that intercourse without condoms can cause serious and sometimes fatal diseases. I’ve heard that going too fast can lead to infection. And that condoms don’t provide immediate protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you say you’re straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am! And I’ve been tested for STIs and haven’t had an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you take precautions? What about personal hygiene?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty good at that. I wash my hands after sex and after sex often enough to make sure none stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you take precautions after sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sex I use a condom, but usually only under very duress and for a very brief time. I don’t take precautions at other times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a condom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why don’t you just fuck me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to fuck you, but I’m too scared to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a fuck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I do. I might be bisexual and that makes me less safe. But I might be scared of what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re too scared to be safe. You could infect everyone you love. It’s not too late to change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am changing my mind. I’m going to have my first ever sexual experience tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please stop fucking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay! Fine! Great! Now let’s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christ, you’re such a tease.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a recount of one night in a gay cruising bar. This is not a recount of one drunken night in a gay bar. This is my story. My story. So I began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of ‘89 I was in the process of becoming a fully fledged American Christian. No, really. You read that right. At the time I was working at the small boutique gift shop selling Christian girls tchotchkes and earrings. One Sunday morning I went to the Women’s March on Washington. I had just come in from a retreat in Wyoming where we had conducted a sit-in protest march to commemorate the civil rights movement. I was in the process of becoming a full fledged Christian when I noticed a young black woman sitting behind a barricade reading the words from the first chapter of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes in there saying, I am, only I’m trying.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What came over me like a ton of bricks was that woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Away we go, let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that moment on I vowed to myself never to be ashamed of my sexual identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would live every day like the story of Lazarus, refusing to be sickened by the sight of a John, or the smell of a John, or the sound of a John.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would walk the streets of Washington D.C. with a sign that read, Fuck the Law and Fuck the Church. I would attend Bible Studies and believe that I knew God when I saw him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would spend days in coffee shops and on street corners with men who shared my same passions for reading the Bible and watching porn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would kiss boys and girls and think it was all wonderful. I would fall in love with beautiful boys and girls just like Matthew and Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in love!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of that was fake. The real Jesus was nowhere to be found. Fake. Jesus didn’t exist. All of that was wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fool. You fell in love with a boy in a coffee shop who knew no one and just wanted to get laid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fell in love with a beautiful blue-eyed boy who fell in love with you on the first date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fell in love with a gay barkeep who told you that you could be anything you wanted to be if you just bent over and kissed the right amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fell in love with a temple garment and a set of Five Principles and a twelve-step program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You even fell in love with your mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why’s everything all so so quiet now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of God is not a fairy tale. And that was enough to drive me crazy. So I packed my suitcases and left. I vowed never to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corpus&quot;&gt;Corpus&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 34 The Conversation</title>

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you and I want you to be my lover, my rock, my life, my life with me as long as I live. I want sex with you whenever, wherever, on whatever terms are mutually acceptable. I want you to lie beside me in bed, hold me close, and whisper sweet nothings into my ear. Kiss me gently on the forehead, lick me on the cheek, nuzzle my hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go on. I want you to undo my fly buttons. Pull my blouse down. Pull my underwear all the way down. Pull my sex toy between our legs. Dry me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to finger fuck me. Fiddle with my clit. Bite my nipples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to feel you push me onto the bed. I want to feel you stick your dick into me. I want to rock on my back, to squirm in my jeans as you fuck me. I want you to turn me over on my stomach and grind against me. I want to feel you rim my pussy with your cock. I want you to slip your dick inside me. I want you to pound me until I am screaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want all of this for you. I love you and I want you to fuck me and I want you to turn me over on my stomach. I want you to stick your dick into me, to rim my pussy with your cock, to pound me until I am screaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you so scared of? That one queer might hear you, see you, touch you. That one might walk by and make eye contact. What if they got a peek? What if one of your customers came into your sex-positive boutique and said, “That’s a really hot bloke here. He talks dirty.” Or, “I bet he fucks teenage girls on the street corners.” Or, “He says he likes big cocks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want all of this for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to tell them all about how fag is better than straight and how queers are way too horny to be happy. I want you to make them queers proud of themselves. I want you to change the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you’ve got me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted you to change the conversation. That’s why I came up here today. To change the conversation. And I’ve got my ace up my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 33 Credible Person</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex and romance without the fear of being judged a pervert or a pervert’s wet dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fantasy so awesome, you wouldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken you to places nobody has gone before. You walked arm in arm with your childhood sweetheart, your best friend’s mother, poured over her shoulder to the jazz club, across the street to the farmers market, hidden in that one gay bar where you met those first few friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you turned, searching, asking the same questions over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer boys and girls together in gay bars doing the same things that you and I do every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer boys and girls in queer leather and punk rock performing in front of thousands of screaming heterosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, in our fantasy, there are no rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No rules?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules that say you can’t kiss because that might spoil the fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that you can’t flirt because that might lead to jealousy or other forbidden behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that you can’t go to the gay bar because it might attract weirdos or the cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that you can’t go to the gay ave because it might invite attacks on the body or the minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we call these safe sex no-no’s are really just excuses for picking on and attacking the weak. Because it’s you against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, we’re not the only ones who have been brainwashed by bigots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gay community has been brainwashed by bigots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve succeeded in brainwashing us into giving up our most cherished civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And turning our back on the millions of wonderful people who come out of the homosexual closet each and every year. They’ve succeeded in brainwashing by demonizing, demonizing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good Lord knows, we could use a little Tear-it-up, tear-it-down, Momma-Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right on. Let’s check our privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty! Equality! Fraternity! Brotherhood! Patriotism!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you see, I grew up hearing that being gay was okay. That being gay was not such a big deal. That you could be…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A GOOD PERSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Credible Person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that if we chose to be like that, we would be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was happy for a time. I was happy for a time. And I still am. Because today those days are over. I don’t go to sleep anymore knowing that, boogeyman, that some radical group of kids was going to demonstrate and gun down those kids just because they were gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not our reality. My brother, Joe, is dead. And those kids just got killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, you said something really nice about my cousin last night. He’s really a swell guy. Don’t get cute. Respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Shepard is a walking Super-Duper Tom Tucker. He’s a product of the left-wing Super-Duper Tom Tucker Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t flatter yourself into thinking you’re any more than slightly tainted by those toxic waters. There are plenty more like you. You probably think you’re just like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I don’t look like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think being gay is like being Mexican, black, brown, or whatever?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of good, decent, human beings who don’t fit into those boxes. There are plenty of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of gay white kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit. Let’s not get political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is politics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the political system, Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine living in a world where people like me didn’t exist? Imagine living in a world where people like that didn’t get the love, support, and safety that I did? There are plenty of those folks out there, Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of my childhood with those people. I didn’t have to grow up with that garbage either. There are plenty of us just like you.
Those poor kids went through hell. They never got the love, support, or safety that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. I was one of them. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of “us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. And I’ll always be one of those “us.” But there are plenty of “us.” And plenty of “us” not like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. I told you. It really is that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think this little insight really hammers home just how simple it is to be me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My lover will disappear. I have a lifetime of secrets to keep and he will never see me. I have all the proof. And what am I going to do? Abandon him? Flee to a safe place away from prying eyes and a screaming public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. You have to be brave enough to say it. And tell the world. There is a world out there waiting to be heard. Queer people are not safe from the world. They are on the run. And if they run, so do we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you running from the facts? Or the truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never afraid to be unpopular. I was never afraid to flaunt my queerness. I practiced what I preached. I vowed to myself never to reveal a secret. I was never ashamed to wear my queerness proudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what would you think if I told you I was a psychopathic serial killer? Would you wonder where I went wrong, what I could have done to make you less likely to love me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you would. Or maybe not. But that’s a decision you will have to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you going to live your life like it is or are you going to discover that it isn’t true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many nights I craved the closeness of a good, long lesbian night out on the town. I even had my high school prom dress made just for the occasion. I even had my high school prom dress made for two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many nights I dreamed of strapping on my red leather prom dress and heading out into the frigid night air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many nights I craved the feeling of being watched and touched and mopped up by my favorite teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever told you how turned on you can be in front of a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a gay bar. In a gay porno. On TV. I can’t tell you how many nights I dreamed of being gang-raped and sodomized by my fraternity brothers. And how many nights I dreamed of being gang-raped and sodomized by my schoolmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us at that school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of lustful glances, whispered caresses, or groans in gym class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of sexual innuendos, muttered sexual jokes, or groans at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of sexual requests, whispered or whispered in bed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of drunken brawls, fistfights, and fist-fights in the street?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most gallingly of all, how many times have you been the object of a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It’s not for everyone. But for me it’s a beginning, not a middle, not a destination. I want you to be my friend for the next thirty years or so, not just because I want to but because you want to. I want to hang on to that friendship as long as I can ‘cause it’s that friendship that keeps me going. It may not be the friendship that’s making all the difference in the world, but that’s the friendship I have. And that’s what I want. That’s what you have to understand about me. I am monogamous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So? That’s okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay for you. It’s not always so easy, particularly for those of us with less traditionally masculine tastes. But don’t despair. There are still plenty of you. There are always men. And beautiful men. In men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are lots of lonely queer men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are. But they’re isolated and frightened, too. Maybe you are. Or maybe you aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me help you find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to fuck me. It’s a starting place, not an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. Not an end in and of itself. But a starting place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please. I’m not asking if. I’m just being polite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are you asking? I just don’t want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always do. Because I care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. And that’s not always easy to see or understand. Ask your mother. Your friends. They’ll tell you all about it. We care about you because…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to bet who cares more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care about you because I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. That’s simple. But it gets complicated. Because I can’t keep hiding, you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many ways are there to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could keep fucking anyone in the world. That’s why I love you so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So could I. It’s why I want to be your friend forever. To carry on the legacy of that friendship that which began thirty years ago and which you continue to love to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep into your soul, you know you want me to take you to a secluded place away from the crowd and show you the beauty and ecstasy of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one has to see that, not your parents, not your co-workers. Or your doctor. Or your priest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priest probably doesn’t approve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative. What about deep-rooted? What about love? What about deep-rooted in you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mothers, fathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to fuck me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t. NO! No one can! I can’t, my mother. NO!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me, Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking me is wrong. It… is wrong. I don’t want to, it makes me sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m horny, make me horny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make me sick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Fuck me. A good boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting wet. I’m horny, make me horny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very good, very good. Slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I look sexy in your yellow… The sexual revolution has… I… well, if only there was one thing that fucked me up good and sent me straight to Heaven. A moment of silence for what was…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to fuck me, you better fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one minute, please. Just one minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever stupid reason. Guess what? I want to fuck you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, fuck me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clothes are dirty. My friends called the cops. I’m scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a time and place for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You… dummy, why don’t you kiss me? I’ll do anything. Go ahead, get in a kiss, anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiss me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that right now it’s just so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are you afraid of me or am I just showing you my…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, the milk’s back. I took the cooler with me. This is crazy, I am a month pregnant. I feel. So fucking. So full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer bastard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go on, babes. Touch us, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, look at him. Boobs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re nice, aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies have no idea what it’s like to be a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tush! Tush!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first trimester. The first days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hurt. Nothing. It was a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ow, my baby. It’s okay. I feel terrific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then some more…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ow, my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not swollen, just a little tender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tender enough that I can put a cap on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 29 Deviation</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to join me…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fantasy is to pick up, unpack, take everything inside me and go on a wild goose chase across America. I want to leave my clothes in the hamper, my favorite socks in the sock drawer, and my favorite shampoo bottles under the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will we find?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that the more I explore my own sexuality the more aroused I become. You’ve seen enough of me to know that my sensual side lags behind my sexual one. Theres nothing between my legs but your clothes. This is called deviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t want you to do this to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sexual fantasies are very limited, and it is the ultimate taboo to talk about them. Even if you’ve shared them with someone before, you are usually reluctant to discuss them or even get involved in the act itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have to do all of this for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t you love that I care? Or maybe you don’t mind me showing you my clothes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My God! Were doing it again! This is so naughty! You take this thing in your hands and work it into my pussy. Oh God yes.. do it with both hands… hard… good! Keep going… oh yes.. feel it inside you.. inside my bellybutton… inside my thighs… inside my tight little jeans… good… keep going… feeling it inside me, filling me up… oh God I want it so bad.. I want it so bad inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright… it comes out. It’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im giving you a blow job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to watch me do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t you dare!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s going to put a condom on my penis, just like last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that hot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to turn on the shower, I’m going to take all my clothes off, I’m going to dry myself off in the hot water, I’m going to stand in front of you, I’m going to take your clothes off and I’m going to turn on the shower… Owwww thats so hot! Don’t you want to touch me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to touch me, but don’t you want to finger me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good boy. There we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren’t enough surprises this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost felt like Elise in Bluebeard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought Elise in Bluebeard was more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get right down to it, Elise is the spiritual mother of kinky sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a claw in my stomach, like the taste of my own blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love when you stroke my hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way your hands feel on my hips and the way you nuzzle my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love feeling your mouth on my earlobe and caress my cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you kiss me and nose me on the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you nuzzle my forehead between kisses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way the corner of my mouth brushes the back of your earlobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you kiss me and nuzzle my forehead against mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way my hand traces the line of your shoe on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way the bed feels on my hip and under my armpits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you nuzzle my forehead between kisses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way the head of your penis brushes the back of my earlobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way my hand traces the line of your shoe on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taste so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You smell so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dream about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m turning on the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My personal fable. It goes something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have my eager young protégé pitching himself in front of me on a silver platter. Prior and I have been lovers forever, and none of us will know except that we got there together and fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, lady friend. Your story doesn’t stack up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh I get it I get it! My story’s so compelling it makes non-fiction look like history. It’s my story and nobody else’s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Ma, we all heard that story about how Doris Day somehow tricked Martin Luther King into coming out of the closet. And how that story stuck with Dr. King till his death. All those years of waiting for that one black boy to come outta the closet and into the mainstream. Remember the kid at the candlestick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin’s story stuck with Dr. King till his death. Not everyone was so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woody Allen once said something that stuck with me. Whatever happened to innocence? At least in Hollywood it’s all going for the taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had that epiphany after a particularly tiresome movie or television spot? All your favorite gags and story lines are mashed up in your head and used as a crutch to keep you up watching television all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s how I was brought up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine we have a certain role-play in store for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You come running for the door, all excited about what I’ve been cooking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all those candles, incense, incense oil, gourds filled with that forbidden intoxicant, you ready to go… when nary a note, not a note, is left on the table!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to share a fantasy like I have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s it like to be the straight lady who fakes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honey, you’re really cooking for five. Takes a village to make a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it go down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Great. Now let’s entertain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Let’s make Tidy Up Crispy!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could eat this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baking soda and water, lots of baking soda. I baked whole… let me show you… hollandaise sauce! Beeswax. And some Worcestershire sauce! And some Old Bay! And Worcestershire cheesecloth! And a little mayonnaise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love mayo, it brightens things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want your advice on this… mayonnaise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not the mayo, this is the real mayo… the real mayo, made with real mayo! And it’s my new fave!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homemade! By me, for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buenos noches!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 26 Middle Class Homo</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-026"/>
   <updated>2020-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-026</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my Beastie Boy middle child. How many Beasties do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many middle children do you know who secretly fuck other middle children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve known four. or five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four middle children… FIVE!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may deny it, but middle children’s queerness is not a fantasy. It is a fact. It is commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive me for being such a prude. I like to think being middle-class makes me immune to all that snobbery, envy, and mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t? Most of us aspire to something better than mediocrity. We want more from life than being poor, working-class, or gay. What middle-class homo doesn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father is a lawyer. He never fooled around and never took the easy route. He never let my mother down. She believed in me and always gave me everything I wanted. She was my rock. I’d sacrifice anything for her. My two kids, it didn’t matter how debilitating their condition was, they had my unconditional love and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being so goddamn sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You old fart, I don’t need your father’s love or the strained confidence of your mother to know that if I wanted a better life than the one I had growing up in that I should fuck harder than he did. No, I wouldn’t change a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you mean. But most people don’t realize how much more commonplace it is to love queers. In Chico, California, where I grew up, it is commonplace for two adults to fuck. In Atlanta, five young men slept together to avoid bus fares. In Collin, Texas, a gay couple was beaten to death last year after their lovers took their own lives. And last Saturday in Detroit, fifty-three young men gathered for a candle vigil to remember a young woman they had just lost to AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being so goddamn sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. This weekend in Detroit, thirty-one high school students gathered to protest what they perceived as rampant bullying of gay students. In Chicago, an ordinance was passed that calls for the immediate expulsion of students who engage in consensual homosexual acts. And this week in Laurel, Colorado, a mother was arrested after her 16-year-old son told a school resource officer that he was “gay” and wanted to bring a friend to prom dressed as a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired. And I’m not the only one feeling this way. According to a new Pepperdine University School of Law poll, nearly two-thirds of Americans—and nearly four-in-ten Republicans think homosexual behavior is immoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I don’t necessarily think the violence is justified. But then what, exactly are we doing to bring people together? Why do people feel the only thing to hate about people who have something different from us is our sexuality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, we’re not coming here to burn the place down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;I pulled it away just enough for the moon to partially illuminate the room as it slowly began to fade from the sky. With a quiet “Ah,” the hand went back and I was awash in a sea of stars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it. Over on the bed was a pink satin nightgown. It was made from a beautiful soft pink satin that matched the soft pink nightgown that was about half the size of her hips. The necklace was of sorts, a set of twelve bracelets set into a pendant. It was a strange design that seemed to capture the essence of the feminine gender perfectly. It was a wondrous design, made by a person with a gift for design. She possessed the gift of the most intimate knowledge of men and women, and combined it with the gift of the most penetrating insight into their deepest secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached up to remove the clasp and the moonlight streamed in through the broken glass and illuminated the white nightgown. There was a hand at my hip, but I was too drunk to do anything about it. All I could do was to pull the nightgown down around my waist, so that the moonlight streamed through the crack in the material as I played with the clasp. As I did this, a hand came up to cup my mouth and toying with the gold stars that adorned the crescent moon that was now partially covered by the midnight blue sky. I pulled it away just enough for the moon to partially illuminate the room as it slowly began to fade from the sky. With a quiet “Ah,” the hand went back and I was awash in a sea of stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was completely drenched in the brilliant blue midnight that was now partially covered by the sunset gold that had been added by the night gladiators. The darkness was so thick that stars shined slightly more intensely as they passed in front of me. I looked up into the face of an angel. Smiling at the ceiling, I continued: I swam back to the dock, filled with my desire to fuck another person. Suddenly a hand grabbed my wrist and I felt it slip from my hand. I instinctively grabbed at it but it was too strong. I fell onto the bed and lay there in a daze for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the phone rang. It was Emily. On the other line was a woman’s voice. It was a warm, feminine voice, almost feminine in tone. She said, I don’t suppose you could get laid in New Orleans, but there is a place in the District that has some nice women. I picked up the phone and spoke into it. I tried to remember the restaurant and the place, but the words ran together in my head so fast that it was like looking at a jumble of information. I said, I need to go to Kitty’s now. I have a cab with a number that starts in D.C. I can call from there and tell her where I am, and that is all. She said she could give me the number and that was all. I remember her saying that the place was dirty, but I could get it over there if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a surge of desire that day I never got before. I wanted to finger myself and touch myself. I walked into Kitty’s and ordered my food. As I was putting my order, Emily came over and took my order and read it to me. I remember thinking how silly it was to do that in front of her because she knew I would be embarrassed. She explained that she knew a lot of the guys at Kitty’s and that it was her way of showing them off to other guys. She talked about how it felt like they were staring at her in the diner, which made me laugh. She then took me into a bedroom and showed me myself. I was amazed at myself. I was 5’3” and I had big hands and round waists. I had big hands and long legs that gave me a jogging gait. My hands looked sexy in the dark because of the makeup they were put over them. I felt so sexy having sex with a woman because I knew it would be me showing off. I could control my breathing because of the masks I wore. At first I was embarrassed by the idea of showing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Emily if she thought men would be interested in me because of my body. She said it was plausible. Then I thought about all the places I had gone to girls had told me they thought I was hot, so I told her it sounded plausible. She said she had to talk to you. Talk to me. I have a hard time letting go of fantasies about sex with women, even though I want to try it. But I have to face facts. When a man leaves me, he leaves his wife and child for a woman. That’s a frightening thought. And even though I know it doesn’t mean things are going to change, I still feel a deep kinship with that poor girl. She may not be around to see it, but I will always have that window of opportunity. That night, I had a fag. I have a secret. I only eat it after sex. I know that’s a turn-on, but it’s all too much trouble to get it down. Just make it a Sodom or Gomorra. Maybe that’ll turn some heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, I loved the way your feet felt on mine as we walked. I wanted to curl up next to you and kiss you like you used to do when we first met. I wanted to feel the warmth of your body on mine as we cuddled and kissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to have sex with anyone I want. I don’t care how old you are. I don’t care if you’re a junkie, a pre-op, or a grown-up. I don’t care if you smell of beer, smoke, or have a crusty middle-aged mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you. Then fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to kiss? Let me kiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Half-assed kiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giggling and grinding against you, unable to control myself, I grab your wrist and pull you against the wall. I slip my hand inside you and cup your bulge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giggling even more, you say, Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking god, you smell so good. You taste so fucking good. Slurp. Moans. Tastes so fucking good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, I need to fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you taste. You taste so fucking good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get on your mark. Run your hand up my slit and feel how wet it is. Run one finger up and down my slit, imagining what it would feel like to fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck my nipple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel my clit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep going. Feel my clit again, imagine how hard I would ram a cock into your tight little asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel my clit again, imagine how hard I would ram a cock into your tight little asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lick my swollen clit clean with your saliva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck my nipple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lick my swollen clit clean with your saliva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times do I have to tell you, how many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to love a good fuck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you one final time. Half-assed, I jack off in my bathroom, just like I told you the night I disappeared. Just like I told you the night we got busted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your cock tastes so good, why don’t I suck it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I have to suck your big cock?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I tell you that I love big cocks? I love cocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That surprise is really pretty big. You must give it to someone. Someone special. Tell me. Give it to me. I want it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 23 144 Loving Arms</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-023"/>
   <updated>2020-11-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-023</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college, I went to a retreat for gay men in Florida. There were eight of us in a room with 144 men and only three women. All of us had had sex before we met and none of us ever had it again. All of us had learned to live with the possibility that one night our secret might be revealed. There is no need to get sultry tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the women broke down during the lull in the action. We were all in a trancelike state and she blurted out, “I’ve had sex with several men this way. I’ve even had orgasms while doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never had sex with anyone besides my husband.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve only had sex with men who were also gay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Therefore I don’t know if I can love you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been attracted to men. I was even attracted to boys! But one evening I realized I had fallen in love with someone completely different. No more heterosexual books or movies for me. I was an explorer. I could be anywhere and I could be anything I wanted to be with anyone I wanted to be with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been so in love you fell in love with the entire world and suddenly regretted it the next day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could fall in love with anyone. I could fall in love with my television, my computer, my friends. I could even fall in love with my mother. But I did what any good lover would do… I went out and FOUND HIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with a man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. I found a man. A true homosexual! A true HE- man! He was a stay-at-home father, a stay-at-home mother, an Amazon shopper, a stay-at-home homemaker, an Army buddy, a stay-at-home grandfather, an Amazon homemaker, and the President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we have it. You can finally pick and choose among the many loving arms that surround you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s say I have all these wonderful and beautiful arms. But how do I know which one is which?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in percentages. A big percentage. How many men are in a room with 144? How many loving arms can a man have? Is it seven? Is it five? Is it even a four? Do you know how many feet are in a mile? Or how many fingers are on a hand? Or how many feet is the radius of the earth? And how many inches is the width of the moon? Or how many feet is the length of the Grand Canyon? And how many miles is the width of the Grand Canyon and the length of Manhattan Island? And how many people is the mass of the sun and moon and the earth? Is it six?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only six inches between a man and a woman. A woman’s size doesn’t matter. A woman’s curves. There are curves. There are no curves. You can’t see a woman’s curves. All you can see is what you put in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so fine. I have forty-seven loving arms. I have 144 bevy of arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 21 Why We Marry</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I was in the process of becoming a nurse. When I finished high school, I had the advanced training to become a doctor. I wanted to do both. I wanted to love patients and be doctors. So I was the ideal match for the Kinsey Reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you sleep with every man? I mean, would you sleep with all the hunky high school guys? Or would you settle for the studious junior high school teacher? Or the reserved professor? Or the outgoing nurse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would depend on how the relationship went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you want to keep me or give me away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that like saying I’m gay or straight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been straight. And I have never been gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since when do you say that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I read your book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My book is called Why We Marry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the book down several times and when I finally picked it up, it was with a big smile on my lips and a big “I See You” in my voice. I don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you were the only gay person I knew who had read my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. And who read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have secrets. Not just about ourselves. We lie all the time. About our lovers, our friends. About the things we’re embarrassed about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guilty again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, there is one place in the McKinney Bookstore where you can buy my entire Kinsey Reports collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening has all the trappings of a slumber party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please. Let’s get back to the motel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 20 Ultimate Fear</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-020"/>
   <updated>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-020</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a very young girl, there was a gay boy in my school. He was a regular pupil in the chemistry department, not the best of students, who made all the right errors and often got punished for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day his name was on the school register and he was suddenly ostracized and had to go home. No one would talk to him; his schoolmates didn’t want to know about it, and his parents didn’t want to accept that his sexuality was a secret. And a year later his parents sued the school for discrimination and won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gay boy, by the way, that’s not on. What’s it like to be the only openly gay person in a small English town?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I have to adjust to the fact that my life doesn’t count as ordinary in a way that non-English-speakers don’t have to adjust to the fact that theirs does. We still don’t have the right to be “mainstream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s say I’m an outcast. That’s a much easier target. My only options are to either hide out in the most secret corners of the gay gayborhood or find a more accepting school. Which brings me to my ultimate fear…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the isolation most often accompanies the coming out. When I was in high school, my best friend, a nurse, came out as gay at the end of the year. Before that, he had been polite but distant and self-centered. He told me he was straight when he was thirteen and that it had nothing to do with the things we loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took him a long time to come around and tell his parents, who were still somewhat against his decision. I think it was a matter of being rejected so many times by so many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, there wasn’t even Blanche DuBois. I don’t know if coming out would have made a real difference to her life. Probably not, anyway. She had a very straight-White mother, and even though she was pretty open about her attraction to boys, she was perfectly content being a housewife and mother to a white kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mama, there are so many stereotypes about queers out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son is very open about his sexuality. He’s not ashamed of it. In fact, he’s very happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexuality, in general, is still a very new thing. There are so many people queer or multiracial out there. And in many parts of the country, it’s illegal to be homosexual. It’s still illegal in thirty states! Or in the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hank and I are very much in the pro-homosexual camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. And as a lesbian myself, I’m always cautious when I shoplift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t you think it’s important for us to be out front and make our case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is. I do think it’s good public policy to be out front and to be as forthright as we can. People need to know that queers exist and that we’re not easy targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could make the same case about Alan McCarthy, who in the late fifties came out as a dyke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t make the same argument about a mensch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could theoretically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 19 Tenet Master</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-019"/>
   <updated>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-019</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div style=&quot;padding:100% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/648204030?h=db9cba6c1f&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;tenent-master&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;I believed that I could create a pure, whole person out of nothing at all. I would imbue my being with the pure, divine spark that was Tantra, Hatha Yoga, Wicca, Confucianism, Taoism, and so forth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young, I had the fantasy of starting a cult. A religion. I would build a great temple of Wicca up high in the sky, worshiped by all the deities of my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many other Disney princesses, I believed that I could create a pure, whole person out of nothing at all. I would imbue my being with the pure, divine spark that was Tantra, Hatha Yoga, Wicca, Confucianism, Taoism, and so forth. I would set my heart on a path of personal and professional growth that would ultimately lead me to a position of great responsibility and ultimately the crowning glory of my being: a Tenet Master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe deep down, among the many millions of deeply held beliefs that make up the American dream, that there is one indisputable truth that I hold dear: love trumps money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went shopping for a no-knead yeast bread, artisanal vanilla ice creme, and coconut shreds and I paid twenty dollars for it. Thirty dollars for an artisanal vanilla ice creme that has traces of burnt orange and tastes of coconut. Fifty for a slice of lemon with a little bit of mint floating in it. A hundred for a six-pack of beer. A super-duper brewery!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know what you’re thinking. Isn’t this what normal, grown-up folks do? Grab a bottle of whisky and go for a fiver. No gym? No diet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite my rationalizations, I was desperate for the forbidden fruit. I wanted something that would give me the shivers, the flash of a first date, the nudge in the right direction, and then, miraculously, disappear. And I found it. And when I touched it, it was as if someone had pulled me right into their arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was sweet and sour and… And smell it. It smelled just like… heaven. Heaven in a can. Heaven on a stick. Make love in a can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Stars were dancing across the brilliant night sky. In a blur I pictured you sitting there, arms outspread, enjoying the view, your legs spread apart apart, completely nude from the lighting. There was just one problem. There was no starlight.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was making love to you. It was over moon rockin in the dark with the moon just barely in the sky. Stars were dancing across the brilliant night sky. In a blur I pictured you sitting there, arms outspread, enjoying the view, your legs spread apart apart, completely nude from the lighting. There was just one problem. There was no starlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you hear the one about how stars don’t glow because they’re full of static? Well, that was true then, and it is true now. Most of us just give up on stars when they get too crowded… or are too bright. We settle for the halo effect… or the twinkling of an orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go to a secluded spot where I can let my imagination run wild. Let it happen. Even in New Orleans it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go to a secluded spot on a wooden pier where the waves crash against the side of a cliff, and the water is so cold I could melt in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go to the edge of a lake where the waves crash against the metal deck, and the wind is so strong that the sail of a ship can be seen twirling in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to take my clothes off in the moonlight and float naked across the cold waters of the Dead Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;I swam across the clearing to the river, dove into the murky murky murky water, and then, as silently as if I had just come out of a bathroom, I disappeared. It took hundreds of men working in perfect unison to unearth me.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young, I could love like none other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the fairy godmother to every little boy. They called me “Flute-Tossing Hot-Puss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every summer, I would arrive at camp sated, my hair in a frenzied tangle, my nails in a tartarfie tangle, my fingertips laced with holy oil, my boots black with mud, and studded with golden bracelets worn backwards. My white socks were studded with lapis lazuli, and the tops of my white dresses lined with lavender shawls and fringes of ocher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To each child I gave jewel-encrusted bracelets, earrings, and earrings pendants valued at a reported $150,000.00. My favorite, a blue rhinestone, confessor’s ring, cost me just shy of a quarter million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day, out on the paved path that connected the camp to the forest, all the way out to the river, a flash of white illuminated the entire clearing like an ultramarine sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swam across the clearing to the river, dove into the murky murky murky water, and then, as silently as if I had just come out of a bathroom, I disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took hundreds of men working in perfect unison to unearth me. Each man had to locate the other’s footprints in the mud, the broken glass, the burned out vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 16 All-Out War</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-016"/>
   <updated>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college I was the most charmed girl on campus. I was so in love with the very idea of collegiate sexual liberation that I vowed never to let it slip again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College was the Wild West. Lovers threw themselves into the unknown, met their maker on the other side. It was a time of wild sex, sexual discovery, and, above all, the irrepressible desire to share one’s passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in the early eighties, a drag queen named Fran Chernow walked into the college gay bar and announced that she was a drag queen because she could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was during this time period that I first came to know Dan White.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days, collegiate gay life was all-out war. In one fell swoop, the administration had declared that all students, regardless of sexual preference, could be grouped together in a sex-segregated “A” category and be assigned a single, one-night-stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember standing at that altar that night and contemplating the depravity of my situation. The Lord had no compassion for the sinner! I vowed that I would never again be so easily offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years wore on, the quality of the sex acts among the “A” category students ranged from filthy to downright filthy. One evening, all the leading lights of the college drag circuit came together to watch Fran’s fabulous new show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, you two. You’re not getting any sleep tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t finished the show.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we’ve read it and we’ve agreed to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could see how the administration’s clever little move might turn out to be their downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was in college, a professor of mine came up to me and said to me, “Mr. Vinge, I believe you know Mr. White. He is a homosexual of some sort. What can I do for you in this situation?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I had never heard of Dr. White. Then, all of a sudden, all of a sudden there was Dr. White in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was dumbfounded. He was so down-to-earth and down-to-nothing about his life that I was dumbfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me most about Dr. White was his complete lack of homophobia.
In other words, he was one big, happy, green, high-achieving, heterosexual, gold-digging, Methodist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only person involved in this who wasn’t wearing a gay wedding band was my roommate, Dr. Kitty Cochrane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the story gets even weirder. My roommate got harrumphed up and led out of the house on trumped up charges of battery. That was just the beginning of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, enough of that. I want to move on and I want justice for all of us. We have all taken sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this college has suffered a tremendous loss when a truly distinguished professor is disgraced by his roommate’s lesbianism. I’ve always considered this a witch hunt, brought on by left-wing radicals determined to silence anyone they perceive as expressing conservative views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school my best friend Alan was gay. We slept together in his dorm room only to have me have to go home alone after midnight. The next morning I found that Alan had propositioned me on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that this happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that any of you knew that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how many of you knew this and didn’t do something about it. I don’t know how many of you didn’t know this and will go to jail for eternity for not knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This silence is painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was angry. I was confused. I cried. I reasoned. I searched. I prayed. But I left feeling freed. I had hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you suppose is going to happen next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who do you think is going to have sex with next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I was angry. I panicked. I didn’t know what to do. I still don’t. All I know is that I got home safe and well that night and haven’t looked back. I’m a lot better for having had that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’d you tell Alan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t know. And besides, I didn’t think it was fair to make him feel bad about what he’d done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair enough. I forgive him now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about that night all the time. And I still get pissed off when I think about it. I get so mad I punch a wall. I get so mad I got a wood chipper. I even got a beer can. But there’s always next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how’d you feel about our having sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I approve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? I want to know what you think about having sex with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not the point. The point is that you and I slept together. You know how I feel about romantic relationships. As a matter of fact, I think sex is the single worst thing a guy can do to a girl. Pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filthy habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a very young girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid fucking girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fantasy was to slip into a boy’s bed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the only boy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck the cock,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would lick, suck, fuck, fuck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy would come all over me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt so good,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made him cum over and over,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called him Daddy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He came over and over,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his face with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his mouth with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made him clean my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot mess all over my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took turns fucking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his ears with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ground his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ground his balls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his face with my wet sandpaper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his mouth with coconut oil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kneed his balls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sanded his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took turns fucking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his ears with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took turns fucking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his ears with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ground his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sanded his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hated me. Wanted me dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scared me to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, I made sure to check&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the one checking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he would stand at the door, take his from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shhhhhhh! He knew I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I pushed open the door and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he stepped out onto the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see the blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see the blood everywhere. Everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could taste it on his lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran. I ran as fast as I could,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tearing, I heard her call out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owwwwww! He grabbed hold of her wrist and pulled her backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he dropped to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hear her scream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wet sandpaper covered his entire body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he lay there. For hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! He looked so real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! I could taste his blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! I could taste it on his lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I heard someone call out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on! Come out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he opened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no one. Just him and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Just him and the empty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw myself at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he lay there. I covered him in my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain. For hours.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 13 Paralytic Fraternity</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young and very foolish, Gay Girl in Love. I was thirteen years old. And I fell in love with a beautiful young man who seduced me with the promise of more beautiful things. I called him my boy friend. We fell in love and lived happily ever after. For thirteen years I was confused and unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a new book out that will change your life. When I picked up this copy I figured it out months ago. Rainbow PUSHED! It has all the information you need to know about bisexuality, gay men, lesbianism, queer theory, history, sexuality, healing, strength, courage, and the power of dreams to make the world a better place. Buy it now and discover for yourself for the first time what it really is like to be queer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why all of a sudden hate Raymond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate Raymond because he could be my lover, my rock. He could rock me to sleep and then lead me on wild wild goose chases down dark alleys. He is traditional, he is American, he is Western. He could be my dad! He could rock my world! It would be so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I be your imaginary friend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closeted big gay man with daddy issues would never be tolerated. Filled with feelings I call Paralytic Fraternity, Raymond would reject me for all the pain and confusion I caused myself and my family. He would reject me for who I am. I would reject him for the many amazing men I have loved and missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are worse things than closeted big gay men with daddy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is not so much my past. My problem is with the way society has defined my sexuality. There’s this idea that if you’re gay you’re fine, fine. It’s not always easy being gay. Our society puts a value on sex and it puts a value on love above all else. Our society says if you’re skinny, you’re a fag. If you smell bad, you’re a fruit. If you smell good to your girlfriend, you’re cool. Whatever it takes to be famous!… I just don’t see how any of that makes any of us wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should we change if they DON’T WANT TO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college, I came home from a party with a really horny high school senior who kept telling me how he and his friend Jake were planning to have a “Boy Love Night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I related this story to my friend, she blurted out, “What’s so funny?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought for a moment, then said, “He’s straight!” And “How are they going to get it up in here?” And “How are they planning to get it up?” I felt my jaw drop open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to denigrate any of those relationships. But there are aspects that struck me as particularly perverted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys, I have a confession to make. It’s late, I’m exhausted, I’ve got dinner to go, and I just want to be alone with my most sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it. We’ve all got to turn on the lights. Please join me. This is the part of the show where I explain to you why my ex-boyfriend and I have been lovers since the day we first laid eyes on each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 11 Gay History</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lover number one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, this sweet sixteen year old me, my best friend Susan, and I, all had a secret lesbian crush on each other. Our first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cruising the gayborhoods of Atlanta, Florida, my best friend Joan was leaving for San Francisco for the summer. I asked, Why do you always have to be so politically incorrect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lover number two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were both in the feminist closet. We hated each other terribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we began to wonder, Why do you always insist on being so politically incorrect? How dare you use the N-word in front of my ex-girlfriend. How dare you use the F-word in front of my best friend. How could you use those words to my ex-Lover in front of her best friend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so ashamed. It was my fault. It was her fault. We both fucked up. We both blamed ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s change the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lover number three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I told my best friend Annie about this “fag” we had been Glorious. Ann was incensed. She thought it was the most despicable thing I could possibly be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How dare you use those words to my best friend. I am so embarrassed. I could have been killed. You could have been mauled. How dare you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, years later, here we are writing this book and you still insist that it all started that way. You still claim it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer folk, this is not going to do any good for you. I am sure you will all come to understand that our history is not as tragic as you might have thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is not something you can change. History is not black and white. History is not neat. History is always murky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make it clearer by keeping our history in the murky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I walked into a gay bar right now and asked the friendly waitresses if they remembered a certain “fag,” they most certainly would not know. They would most certainly not be able to give me an honest answer. I would most certainly be disappointed. Most people have a hard time accepting that there might be a gay past in the first place. It almost feels like a challenge to the very fabric of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lover number four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days, you didn’t even have to ask. Why do you continue to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History will judge us, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

This year’s Michigan Wolverines have been renamed the “Gay Wildcats.”And, of course, it’s all but guaranteed that there will be homosexual hooliganism.

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 9 The Public Condom</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, this sweet, innocent, bubbly geezer from Mendocino, California, came over for dinner and had the most incredible meal. We chatted all day and night about life in the gay and lesbian community and his favorite subject was “The Private Life of the City.” He talked about cruising the city, going out to bars on Friday nights, and even went as far as to buy me a leather briefcase with sex toys inside so I could take all my fantasies to the clubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’d taken me to gay clubs and explained to me that none of the guys there used condoms and that it was the girls that used them. No one ever said anything about it being a perverted thing to do. He even went as far as to buy me a “public” condom, which was only intended for close male friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought for sure he was being melodramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t. He was genuinely moved by my reaction and told me he wanted to do something about it. I was over the moon. I felt I could do something about it. I even thought maybe I could become his secretary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not one of those gay “Christs-for-Jesus” that believe in any kind of heaven, but I was sold on the idea of being his “public” condom. I was willing to do almost anything for him to keep my secret. I would do anything to keep my boyfriend and my brother from knowing. I even had my parents believe I was gay and started researching them and sending them Christmas cards and school supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did he say when you told him all this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was disappointed. He told me he had made a big mistake. He’d like to take some time to think about it and come to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He couldn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was angry. He said he loved me very much and that I always put his best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have been hurt, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in shock. I never wanted him to see what I saw. He was the most amazing, sensitive, funny, beautiful boy ever to walk the face of this earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mean he turned gay after that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He could have been lying down the gurney any minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sainted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was your age, in college, cruising the interwebs, cruising the high school, cruising high schools, there was one boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to show off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to keep my clothes in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know when I feel tired. I get so excited about things. I get so excited I want to go out and beat the shit out of this corner store, this little orphan shop, this theater, this park, this theatre, this sign, this flower, this mirror, this telephone booth, this mirror, this carpet, this life, this book, this book, this carpet, this chair, this carpet, this sign, this street, this walkway, this sign, this lamp, this tree, this brick, this table, this rug, this blanket, this sign, this book, this blanket, this chair, this table, this blanket, this rug, this chair, this lamp, this tree, this walkway, this light, this chair, this rug, this table, this lamp, this blanket, this table, this rug, this chair, this sign, this street, this lamp, this blanket, this table, this lamp, this rug, this chair, this table, this sign, this street, this lamp, this blanket, this I’ve never been in a room with anyone who thought, “Oh, this person is very interesting, I could be very interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people like to be big. You’re very popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh! I’m very popular. Very! Very! I’m very, very famous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a very big house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a lot of friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been in a room with anyone who thought, “Oh, this person is very interesting, I could be very interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been in a room with anyone who has said to me, “You are very interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what you are. You are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m very, very ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no idea what it’s like to be unattractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I must be very unattractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh! Oh! I am very attractive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 7 The Gayborhood</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-007"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a kid, the only people I was allowed to see in a public place were those I knew and loved. Those closest to me were either priests or middle-aged white men. It was forbidden to me to go to the gayborhood or the drag queens’ district. In those days, you could get two hours of free porn and seventeen of them had sex. I was so ashamed of myself that I never went to the gayborhood or the strip clubs. I wasn’t gayborhood or drag queen stripper girl, I wasn’t even a gay boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know that there were any gayborhood strippers, clubs, or even gay men. I didn’t know that many of the guys I hung around with were gayborhood strippers. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhood minors were gay minors. And I certainly wasn’t part of the gayborhood clubs. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhood minors actually lived with their partners. Or that in the gayborhood the bars. Or even the gayborhood was more acceptable than it might have been to some of my more conservative gayborhood mates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fantasy wasn’t to find out about my queerborhood or my life with the minors. It was to find out if there were any other gayborhood minors. I wasn’t interested in that. And so, over the years, I’ve had it with you. And sometimes, it’s even got me wondering if my only queer experience was being the subject of that sad, sad, sad boy’s fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could have one secret lover?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had one secret lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did you keep that book of erotic poetry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept it in the bathroom at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever get together with that much male fantasy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure. Do I have to describe it to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course not. That’s one secret. One lover. One secret lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you please leave out the “one”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that you don’t know how to be a good lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you going to make love to me or are you just going to sit and wait for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I could get you a ring so we could make love together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t make love to me, you’re just a big, old, hard-on, angry, boring monster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care what you are! Make love to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want me to lie down and hold your hand while you do your French Bend? Is that what you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I’d like to feel your body against mine. I’d like to feel you in your arms, always safe and warm in my arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You like sex in public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it in private. I love when you make love to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to get down on your knees and kiss me? How about it? Giggling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giggling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to suck my fingers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to suck my nipples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss my pussy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss my ass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to make love to my face?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you want to do to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make love to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You like to take pictures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picturing? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to watch me get fucked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex and Fuck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you want to do to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to take your clothes off and kiss you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to get your dick deep inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see your balls bounce around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to fuck you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so wet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m dripping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smell of sex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smell of jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to hear me moan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to feel my pussy lips?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to taste my clit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a really horny monster, aren’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so hard, I’m so horny!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so hard, I’m so horny!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to feel you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a good feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a dirty monster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you feel my clit again. You can feel it building inside you. Then you feel me against your back and the first time I feel you against me, I pop! I CUMM! Such a good feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you can feel my balls slapping against your back and the first time I feel you against me, I feel you cumming! I CUM! Such a good feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you can feel my body shivering and slick against yours and then I can hear your heartbeat against my skin and I can hear my zipper opening as you try to pull yourself free but you can’t!

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds ridiculous. “Hotline Miami” gave me chills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hotline Miami?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to have it. I had to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh come on! It’s not true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the most exciting thing I’ve ever had. It’s true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hotline Miami”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me the straight answer. Don’t give me that. Let’s all just talk about what’s real right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Let’s talk about what’s real now. Okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand your need for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you do know how to spend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do you know how to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t drag your Ex-Boyfriend into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s real about my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ex-boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s real about your ex-boyfriend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s angry. He’s jealous. He’s needy. He’s a faggot. He needs you. He’s a bimbo. He’s straight. He’s old-fashioned. He wants to fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to fuck him! I want to fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you said that it’s only because we broke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t you even know how to kiss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that he wanted to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to fuck you but I don’t know how!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You said that you had ideas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you have ideas about?!?!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just know you want to fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just know that’s all you ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, but, but. But…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re asking me to kiss a gay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 4 Zero-Sum Game</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in fifth grade, a boy from the school assembly told me that he had been in love with a girl named Florence. The boy had been in and out of love and lust for many years, but one night, as he was leaving to go away to school, he asked his teacher if she was gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher said that she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he told her that he loved her and that he was in love with her too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she ran off to tell her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the father was apoplectic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the teacher reassured him that his love for his son was genuine and that he could love anyone he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was five and a half years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I am in love with you, the bisexual hound, and we have been together for three years, and we are in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t want to be intimate with you, the heterosexual hound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay, it’s okay! It’s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me see, how many ways are there to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many ways are there to be gay? How many ways are there to be bisexual? How many ways are there to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see it as a zero-sum game. You get one and you have to get the other. If you get one, you get one less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have to be gay to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a zero. I could love more than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot more. More than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could love someone much more than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter. I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t love someone just because they are your lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not just because they are your lover. I love you because you are a good friend and because you want to be good friends with me. I don’t care if you’re my lover or not. I just want you to be a good friend and to want to be good friends with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a junior high school English teacher in Texas. My school was in the middle of a gay rights march. On the square near the square, there were gay men kissing in front of the assembly and chanting “Hands off our buxom women!” in the square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a gay man myself, I was outraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing at all resembling “homo” or “bimbo.” And there were no signs at all that said, “Homo-Bimbo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess that’s the ultimate fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a private lesson in gay rights, and the boys I taught were all closeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had a gay teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. That’s right. You had a gay teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you had sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly. I was fond of him and we had consensual sex. My point? We didn’t know for sure. But it was a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were a senior in high school. You had the chance to change your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a writer’s assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were an assistant editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked as an assistant to a writer. I wrote a story and had it published. Then I got promoted to writer’s assistant. So I wrote a screenplay and had it directed by a famous director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were in love with that writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lied. I wasn’t in love with him. I had sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea what that means? That’s called jealousy. You were doing research on this gay man. You were consulting with this famous director, on what you thought were possibly thousands of men. And you turned around and said, “I don’t want to get involved with anyone who is that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a joke. In any case, I had just gotten a promotion to writer’s assistant and I was tired of writing screenplay. I decided to skip the writing phase and concentrate on the casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. You couldn’t act, you couldn’t act tough, you couldn’t act arrogant, you couldn’t act even gay. You could only act like shit. It was the first time in my life I had been so completely humiliated by the person I was working with. I went into a state of paralysis. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I knew that whatever I was doing wasn’t going to make any difference to anyone. And that my only hope of escaping was to give in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn’t do anything about it. You couldn’t say a word. You could only stare blankly into the abyss of apathy. Did you notice anything strange in that abyss? Nothing like that black eye. Did you even notice that it looked different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I can’t remember ever seeing a black eye look this strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of my life in a state of total denial. I could not imagine how anyone could be so stupid as to act like this. It didn’t matter if I was going to jail or not. It didn’t matter if I was going to marry the man or not. It didn’t matter if I had a career or not. The only thing that mattered was that I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. I didn’t want anyone to think I was anything more than a happy little boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you threw in the towel. So you decided to disappear. I’m amazed you didn’t leave me with a bloody nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 1 Club Life and Mothers</title>

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young I loved going out to a club with a gang of boys. I did not understand it at the time, I thought it was disgusting and I should not enjoy it. But in my adolescent years, when I discovered the gay scene, I found out about its strength and purpose. This meant it had two forms, boys and men. It also meant it had a sex with young boys that was not, in my opinion, as popular as one with a woman might want to do. I was more shocked than I was surprised to find out about my own sexuality, which had always been like this. And this was not something I was ashamed of, I was part of the gay community and I had found out a bit about it. I would occasionally go to clubs with boys, or with my mother. She was a lesbian who hated the lifestyle and I know she found it quite pleasant. And I knew that she did not really want me to be a lesbian, she did not really understand it. My mother was a staunch member of the “G” club, which was devoted to women. I think I liked her, she did not really hate me, but she was angry at her own sex, and the fact that I would leave her house when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came home late one night and my mother was furious at me. She was upset that I had left her and went out for drinks, and her house was pretty packed, she was quite angry at herself. She and her husband, who was a Presbyterian, were at a pub the night before. I was the only boy there and I was alone, but she saw me coming in. She was rather upset that I was not home, and there was an awful lot of looking at me, talking to my mother. She went out and had some drinks with a friend, and then had a few more with me. She then left for the pub. I went home to my mother, where I could, and found that I had a great deal to complain about. I was going to go to bed and she went off to see my friend. It was a pretty dark evening, dark with the smell of smoke. She called the police and came over to my room. I thought it was dreadful. I saw my friend there and she wanted to see me. She was so happy to see me. I explained to her that I was going to go back to my room. She went off to find her friend. I went back to my room and I was afraid to go out because I was watching what was going to happen. But she was a very good friend and told me not to go out at night. She would give me her handbag and I would carry her and her bag. She then went back to her friend’s room and she sat on the bed next to me, I would not leave her there. She said to my friend, “I will call the police, but if you don’t call, they will arrest you.” And so I went back to my room. And I had an awkward silence and I went and sat down to write. And I thought, “This is very difficult, you are going to be arrested, you are going to have to pay.” She came out and said, “Good, it is quite easy to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life was so bizarre at the time, I was so alienated and so disgusted with myself. But I got out of it, I got over it, and I never had any more time to write.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Life After Capitalism</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After generations of living under colonialism, white supremacy, economic austerity, demoralizing levels of stress, social unrest, a global pandemic, endless fake news cycles, ecological catastrophe, unprocessed grief, extreme nihilism, and near climate collapse, the humans decided to end capitalism, overthrow their corrupt leaders, and begin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they learned how to be in right relationship with the earth and each other, they started reflecting on their shortcomings and asking questions about the true nature of human bondage, human freedom, emotions, mind, God, consciousness, ethics and morality. They ruminated on the consciousness of responsibility, debt, obligation, compensation, community, injury, guilt, alienation, and atonement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems they knew little of pleasure and love that wasn’t tied to suffering and pain. It became obvious . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems they knew little of pleasure and love that wasn’t tied to suffering and pain. It became obvious to them that all enjoyment, all order, all beauty, all reason, all social order, all being absolutely necessary to survive, must necessarily be subordinated to the demands of the most violent, the most vicious, and the most highly developed interdependent powers of nature: the most powerful and richest, the most dominant religions, political systems, empires, and racial distinctions. Nothing remained for them but for revenge, the most ancient and newest form of revenge, the most radical act of self-criticism and personal repudiation, the self-emancipation of the one who deserved all those advantages and privileges, the one who had dared to be free, the one who was nevertheless angry, disgusted, and bitter–for them all to be masters of bitter revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first act of self-emancipation was to repudiate all those privileges, abolish the debts, form new ones, pay back the ones who had lent them, repudiate the masters, to whom they were “owes.” In doing so, they repudiated themselves and their own humanity, for they had repudiated themselves in that very repudiation, by taking up arms in self-determination against their own masters. That repudiation was more radical still, for to this extent was an act of liberation, a final act of passivity, in the self-emancipation of the slaves, the emancipated slaves themselves–they repudiated their very consciousness, all freedom, their very existence, all sovereignty, all right, all privilege, in short, all reason, in order that they might acknowledge and experience again the necessity and fulness of their own power, lord of the free, master of the bad, master of the ill, with a reference to the low, the sick, and the damned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in doing so they showed that they were no longer masters of their own revenge, that they were still cut off from the joy and freedom of their own acts, the self-assertion of the slave, the black pride of “the free,” as their own. “Let us not be free till we are good,” they said, for the joy of their freedom was cut off, the freedom of their own hands was cut off, “but until then we shall be masters of our revenge.” This is still their most radical and radical act, repudiation, even though now only a demand, an ultimatum, a declaration of war, repudiation. The unconditional affirmation of the absolute negative right of any one to revenge is absolutely essential for them, for otherwise the resentful and the wounded immediately return to their own hatred, their own violence, and the new order of things (the ideal society, if such a word can be used in our case) will only be a new phase of “Bolshevism” and caste-war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when they themselves repudiated their own revenge, when they repudiated that which they had so viciously exploited, when they repudiated “owes,” what was left to them but to be punished for their debt to those lords, the masters, who had made such repayment possible? The punishment was their own revenge in the form of their own slaves, the new slaves, their very working slaves, to be made whole again, to be given back their freedom, their joy, their love, their desire. The black pride of the slaves, the vindication of their hatred, was for them their revenge, and in looking down on their own slaves, in apprehending this to be the highest form of love and satisfaction, they were really giving them to taste as much bitter, sharp revenge as they themselves enjoyed in eating their own worms. The rearing of the new slaves was the first and foremost need of those lords: the slaves, freed from the masters, became the lords’ enemies–for it was through the slaves that the lords’ enemies were brought to life again, to the crescendo of all aggressive and pre-aroused wrath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just as the idea of the master’s freedom was the beginning of the world, so is the theory of the master’s right of revenge–the theory of a “reciprocal right” between the masters and the slaves, the theory of the new society as a whole as the kingdom of the masters, an oligarchy, a democracy, with slaves as its subjects. But this theory actually has no further vitality or meaning, and even less virulence than the theory of the masters’ right of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is simple: the whole theory of the master’s right of aggression is only a provisional and provisional system of ideas, an extremely late and provisional elaboration of the theory of the masters’ power, against whose actual existence there is no sign, no matter how piquant and gay its paradoxical expression is: this theory repudiates itself immediately, and repudiates absolutely, repudiates itself as a critique of the real masters’ power, of that absolute, that very dominant and unqualified power, the right of aggression. The theory of the masters’ right of aggression repudiates itself absolutely–how could it possibly have any meaning? The whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiation, and counter-revision is but a specious expression for repudiating the lords’ right of aggression, repudiating in particular the lords’ right of dominating, of proving, potentiating, and extending the “good” in the world. “The masters are the bad,” says the resentful resentful–but the “masters,” who themselves repudiate and fight for their right of aggression, fight for their right to be bad, for their right to be masters. It is at this juncture that we come back to our main theme, the origin of the new order of things,–the origin of the “better man,”–the origin of a new maximum of power, the state, as such, repudiates itself in opposition to that ideal of civilisation, that would be “masters,” that would be an empire opposed to itself, that would be repudiated by the ideal of the good, by the will to be an empire. That repudiation is absolutely essential for the affirmation of the “better man” theory–it repudiates itself, repudiates in particular the whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiates the theory of the masters’ power, repudiates in particular the lords’ will to be masters, the will to be an empire. In doing so, it essentially cuts off the possibility of the “better man” theory actually being a theory at all, and transforming that “better man” theory into a practical deed,–a deed actually constituting the actual basis of the new order of things, the actual organisation of power. The whole provisional theory of the masters’ liberal providence is just such a deed, an actual constitution of that theory, constituting in its actual organisation and working up to the actual power, the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy. What is it, all these theories which have taken up the idea of the masters’ power, all these provisional theories of masters’ rights, counter-repositions and interpretations, are really? They signify nothing. Nothing, for to be able to make a beginning is to be first. The very first that must be found is the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a democracy, that is to say, the will of a relatively small, relatively strong, relatively long-standing, and finally, of all the Europeans, to be an empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this juncture we had better hold fast to the kernel of the matter, to the elementary fact that the real will of the good against the bad, the strong against the weak, is the will for a balance of power. This will, this historic will, has grown–granted that it grows–far beyond the point of any kind of absolute practical proportionality, far beyond the point of being able to bring it about that all Europeans should all fight together for the sake of a balance of power. This historical will is moreover the will to be an empire, the will to be an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy, on a much grander scale, and this out of a whole preponderance of the historic German power on the European continent, which itself alone has an historical and psychological hegemony, which is the will to be an empire. And now look at it from another point of view–what will this historic will be able to create in the European continent, if it does not already constitute it? What will it do for Europeans themselves? This question can be asked only after a hundred times more rigorous analysis–a further analysis which will redoundably be rendered out by an equally thorough and thorough re-examination of the actual political, strategic, and military situation of Europe, in order to throw more light on this problem–a situation which can be practically defined as follows: there exists in Europe a practically decisive strategic and a practically decisive military superiority over Asia, over the Middle East, over the Europe, over the “empire of the north,” France. In the same proportion as Europe’s strategic superiority, and with the same necessary evolution, also exists a necessary evolution of the European military power, thereby taking place, first of all, a tempo and rhythm which was originally only a natural accompaniment to the European strategic advance, the tempo and rhythm which eventually became the necessity of the matter, in Europe, of a balance of power in which the European powers joined. This political and military tempo-and-coma, this extraordinary tempo and rhythm of the European powers, has so far only been maintained, in spite of all the most&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now that Wittgenstein’s homosexuality has been largely acknowledged, most scholars are hesitant to imply a connection between his philosophy and his sexuality – that is, between his work and his inner state, emotions, or personality. If, however, in a contemporary light we understand queerness as a structuring mode of desiring, we might view Wittgenstein’s thought not as emerging from his sexuality, but as structured by the way in which it shaped his mode of being in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERPLEXITY 0.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, his thought may be said to have exuberant, joyous, and full breasts, but beneath all that is there a secretly dangerous, pessimistic, and spiteful inner world, one that struggles to get out and find a home in the masculine sphere. It is this inner world that lies at the core of all the resentful, spiteful, and gay tendencies in the world today. It is this inner world that has imprisoned so many men of the masculine ideal, has made them into hateful, spiteful, and evil-tempered cretins. It is this inner world that has imprisoned so many women of the feminine ideal, has made them into angelic, joyful, and loving. And it is this inner world, in fact, which in spite of all its malignity and wickedness is the only thing keeping many men in the pale, keeps them from being what they ought to be, what they can be: true, moral, and decent men and women who are fit and worthy to be the leaders of the world, the fathers of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERPLEXITITY: 0.7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to know that one likes another? How might one become so thoroughly acquainted with another that one’s self, one’s self as a whole, were thereby altered in respect of substance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, it would mean that we should learn to rate our love more highly on its affective than on its intellectual side. ‘Intellectually’ here is a broad category to cover both intellectual and moral qualities. Desire is ‘attention turned to’ a thing in proportion as its utility increases; so that pleasure is the result of a greater tendency to look at a thing than to look away. Attention turns to a thing because our attention is focussed thereon; and focussedness, similarly, is increased in proportion as a greater number of our ideas about a thing are fulfilled. Desire is also increased when the attention is directed to a thing connoting more of its own nature than of the nature of anything else. Attention turns connotingly when the subject of it is connoted as a whole, and we can, therefore, take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERPLEXITY 1.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Woman,’ he might say, ‘is but a readymade gender transposed.’ His thought, straight out of the gate, is one of genital transposition with a social goal in mind. This goal is conceptual; the transposition itself is only a peculiar form of desiring and acting. The desire which springs from the need to be, to be experienced, to be felt, to bet felt and ‘ated,’ these are the desires here opposed to those of, as we say, the woman who needs but one thing; they are relational desires, as individualist as opposed to collectivistic as they are relational. The prehistoric herd, which needed hands as well as teeth to hunt for sustenance and safety, is defunct, while Cupid, the younger Thanatos, Priapus, and the Olympian mothers look on in rapture. Each of the desires of today, then, is part of a larger ‘will’ that connotes a constitution and a function, the whole of which is fluid and ever shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, then, the learned man be capable of relating contemporary phenomena to earlier ones, he should at all events attempt the corrective of a lifetime’s experience. It was, and remains, a desire unknown to him, even by his most advanced Hegelians and his English idealists; to his straight-A students, however, such conjunctive transitions conjure up, almost as if glowing with magnetic flux, a gender neutral Wagnerian Wohlfahrtsgefühle. In other words, they must be experienced first as they are experienced inside one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To act against that instinct is to pet the beast; and like Faust and the other psychics, he became one of those who fight the impulse. He repudiates, denies, defends and eventually reverses everything which transmits the impulse. His transposing of the feminine into the masculine not only frees him from himself, but from woman in general. ‘I myself am simply my own man,’ he might have said, but ‘for the love of God be my being pure and unmixed: nay, more than purity and unmixed, make it to be one, one only, one undivided being; one supreme, one supreme, all-in-one Being, which I may call God, who is God in m&lt;/p&gt;
