   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 113 Technique</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed a change in your skin? Are your pores sagging? Are the pores sagging more often? Let me show you an exercise. Pull your shirt close over your face, close your eyes, and imagine that sound. It is a very loud noise. Just a really loud noise, enough to draw your attention to your pores, to the fact that they are sagging. Now, imagine that sound again. Now, imagine it five times louder. Make it a song. A favorite, a favorite movie, a sentence that rhymes, such as, “So you see, I’ve failed.” Imagine the song reverberating in your head, making you dizzy, you black out, you pass out, wake up fine, but the next thing you know you are in a hospital bed, your skin sagging again, pores have gone soft and your hair falling out…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me show you how to lose it. You see, you take the exercise and use it to reinforce a bad thought. You take the sheet music and you use it as a springboard for a seductive suggestion. You make love to yourself as though life were an airplane cruising above you. Want me to stop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t have to be an expert on hypnosis. You’re a librarian, remember, not an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow jackets don’t wear yellow jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about this. Put on your blindfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right. Let’s see what we have here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technique!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you stop dreaming? When you can longer see a future for yourself, for those you love, for all of the sentient and non-sentient beings on this planet? When day after day you grieve? When day after day you feel your senses dull, your feelings numb, your spirit shrinking and withering away? When time spirals into a personal hell of your own distorted mind maps and trauma loops? When you can no longer receive the light of love? When your heart stops emanating its own light?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 112 Year of Revelation</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-112"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.
I love you. You have not heard this rumination on the threshold of love, of dukkha. You have heard hoarse screams and gnashing of teeth. And you have allowed this to fester, a sickness that corrupts and eventually kills the heart. You have allowed your very being to degenerate, to warp your very being, and to poison the very air you breathe. You have allowed yourself to be consumed by your own needs so that, eking out a livable income, you allow yourself to become ravenous for more and more in order to feel whole again. You, my dear, do not deserve love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will stop. I will go to sleep as you left me. I will drift off to sleep, serene as the waters of a swimming hole, filled with the odors of your own body. I will drift to rest beside you, my arms spread wide as I can accommodate your full size. You will be so far gone I will not be able to reach you. All I will be able to do is watch, breathless, as your flesh dissolves, your skin dissolves, your hair begins to fall out; then, all of you, I will be left withered to dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a year of revelation for me. I knew this would happen, that deep in my heart I knew this day would come. I was led to believe that deep in my very being there was a wisdom that told me that I had been searching for all year and had not found it. I was then taught a trick I have never used before in order to lose myself in the moment. This is not love. This is not ecstasy. I will shower you with my love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you stop dreaming? When you can longer see a future for yourself, for those you love, for all of the sentient and non-sentient beings on this planet?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
Leave me alone! I will scream when you come into my room at night, as I have during times of crisis. I will yank on your bedsheets, trying to force my way in. I will turn on the lights and you will be too cold to sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wake up!&lt;br /&gt;
It has happened to me. I was young, bright, beautiful. All of a sudden, I was cold, distant, defeated. I had no energy, no drive. I was a walkover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has happened to you. You let yourself get numb and defenseless, letting fear take over, your heart pumping away, your mind racing, your will broken. There is no will, no energy, just nerves, blood, and hard-earned suntan oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you trying to tell me something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes dreams are a warning. They remind us of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you stop dreaming? When you can longer see a future for yourself, for those you love, for all of the sentient and non-sentient beings on this planet?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 110 The Pool</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-110"/>
   <updated>2022-06-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-110</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, we had a band on tour. One night, they tore a hole in the ceiling of our hotel. We were nearly drowned. We were standing on the edge of the pool when the water began to rise. As we swam to safety, a few of the band members jumped into the pool and began to perform a song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water was crystal clear, but the dizzy stage show kept us in the clear. As we neared the hotel, several other hoteliers sprang to attention and began to race down the street toward the pool. I stood watch as the mob swelled to several hundred. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a figure disappear into the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. You didn’t see it. You weren’t paying attention. You focused instead on that one individual you were watching swim toward the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have been scared. I should have been panicking. Instead, I carried on enjoying the show. I slept through most of the next day. The next morning, I was walking down the street with my best friends as the moonlight slowly began to fade. As I turned a corner, a hand grabbed mine and pulled me toward the moonlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM IN LOVE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the most powerful emotional intelligence on this planet. I have the intelligence to see past the obstacles, past the pain, past the hate. The more you try to shove me down, the more I rise above!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more pretending. We can all be whippers and flippers when it comes to love. I know just the person to demonstrate that through the most blatant of flings. I’ve got you. I’ve got you whipsawed between the bars of passion and terror and jitters and needs. And I’ve got you there, the helpless caged animal of my heart, my sweet, my scared little ball of love, where I can do anything and everything to make you happy and safe.
No more pretending. You are not safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care anymore. I am bleeding all over this goddamned bunk!
But I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care anymore either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because once you start being loved, you can’t stop. So it’s over and done with and I’m off home to nurse my wounded pride back to health.
It’s not over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

May the forces of good please me!&lt;br /&gt;
Give me back my jewel box, give me back my skirt. And
Fetch me a fire axe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleanse yourself. The dead are intrinsically miasmic.&lt;br /&gt;
Cleanse with flowers, baths, perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;
Cleanse the doors of perception.&lt;br /&gt;
Learn to open and close doors, build and burn bridges.&lt;br /&gt;
Sing, especially if you never do, sing for them and them alone.&lt;br /&gt;
Cultivate certain qualities - ecstatic, cathartic, flamboyant, chthonic - in all things.&lt;br /&gt;
Practice automatic writing, possessory trance and other methods of channelling.&lt;br /&gt;
Journey to the underworld and find your way out.&lt;br /&gt;
Take breaks, take space, take time, take liberties.&lt;br /&gt;
The freaks come out at night.&lt;br /&gt;
Everything dances.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 104 Major Deities</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-104"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is life.&lt;br /&gt;
If you allow yourself to become lax, you invite disease and disaster.&lt;br /&gt;
May the dead bless you.&lt;br /&gt;
Seize the moment, seize it before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;
Heavenly Host&lt;br /&gt;
Through the ages there have been many sham feasts and ceremonies&lt;br /&gt;
There are also major spiritual processes taking place.&lt;br /&gt;
The major deities at that time were Anahita and Metta Brangas. The Anahita was the conqueror and mother of all the Buddhists. Anahita was a female conqueror who lived in Kashmir.&lt;br /&gt;
Then the Kriyaas and Pranayamaas.&lt;br /&gt;
They were the same two Kriyaas and Pranayamaas, deities separate from each other, holding their power in concert.&lt;br /&gt;
They were actively working together, actively confronting one another.&lt;br /&gt;
The Kriyaas combined the strength of the Anahita and of the Kasturbaas.&lt;br /&gt;
The Kasturbaas, in turn, combined the strength of the Anahita and of the Kriyaas.&lt;br /&gt;
There was an intense, almost anticlimactic struggle… the Brahma battle.&lt;br /&gt;
All of this was meticulously planned, not an accident.&lt;br /&gt;
Sri Lanka was a beautiful island, a secluded haven from the chaos.&lt;br /&gt;
There was a goddess, Sarasvatthu, goddess of love, civilization, childbirth, childbirth, childbirth.&lt;br /&gt;
Sarasvati was jealous of the love of the king. So she made a pact with a monster, a bear, whose bite could kill a man in one bite.&lt;br /&gt;
She then tied the beast to a tree, and from that tree she shot thirty arrows that killed all the mosquitoes and leeches that lived in the area.&lt;br /&gt;
And then she set out on a pilgrimage to Lanka, where she hoped to find the tribe of Aryans and deliver the nation to the Brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate birthdays, deathdays, celebrate accomplishments, celebrate festivals.&lt;br /&gt;
Sketch a map of sacred places, an enchanted geography.&lt;br /&gt;
Walk the old haunts; bars and parks and cruising spots. Therein pick up their trace.&lt;br /&gt;
Some will travel in packs and as houses, others are solitary, Learn how to engage with them together and alone.&lt;br /&gt;
Among them there will be spirits more or less elevated, more or less wise, more or less chained by their traumas.&lt;br /&gt;
Seek the advice of the wise ones, and do not be drowned in the pain and fear of the others.&lt;br /&gt;
You may feel yourself to be dying, you may find yourself rapt in panic and anxiety. This is a cost of the work. Learn to separate what is yours and what isn’t.&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the work will be to assist those who need healing. To show them how to heal themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
Healing may be ecstatic too.&lt;br /&gt;
Cultivate empathy, learn to regulate it.&lt;br /&gt;
Empathy may register as desire, sickness, terror, joy.&lt;br /&gt;
Lean into your anxieties and manias, into your highs and lows.&lt;br /&gt;
Often you’ll find the spirits on the other end.&lt;br /&gt;
Balance is necessary. As you surround yourself with the dead, invite in life in equal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM GOING TO BE A PART OF EVERYTHING!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s too bad. Don’t be alarmed. I just mean that you are not going to be happy living among the dead. There is much that needs to be done here, much that needs to be said, before you can move on to something more permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And before that, before I can give you a definite answer, you must be prepared to give up on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dear friend Oprah, don’t disappoint me. You know I love you, that I missed you terribly when you were away, and I came back to you this time looking very much like the woman I was when you came to visit me in my sleep. Now that you are back, Oprah, I can scarcely wait to meet you and spend some quality time together. But, darling, before we get to that, just tell me one thing, and only one thing, and it must be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no accidents. You have just chosen to be the unfortunate messenger between life and death. It is your choice. If you wish to continue to be a part of this special occasion, you must act quickly. Otherwise, I fear for your safety.&lt;/p&gt;

You will be transported to a time in your life, when you were most happy.&lt;br /&gt;
The garden at your feet.&lt;br /&gt;
The glories of your youth.&lt;br /&gt;
The sounds on the highway.&lt;br /&gt;
The sighs on the highway.&lt;br /&gt;
Silence.&lt;br /&gt;
The dawn of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;
You will be holding a baby in your arms.&lt;br /&gt;
It is premature to talk politics.&lt;br /&gt;
I have chosen a quiet place.&lt;br /&gt;
I have chosen you.&lt;br /&gt;
My duty is not so much to seduce you as to capture you.&lt;br /&gt;
My duty is to capture you and bring you to me.&lt;br /&gt;
But first you must be freed.&lt;br /&gt;
Will you be my slave?&lt;br /&gt;
I have no intention of slavery.&lt;br /&gt;
But I will require that you be my friend.&lt;br /&gt;
You are my enemy.&lt;br /&gt;
I do not consider you an enemy.&lt;br /&gt;
I consider you my friend.&lt;br /&gt;
Then I will do what is best for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;
I can live with as much as you want.&lt;br /&gt;
With as little as you want.&lt;br /&gt;
Then we will live happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;
No. No. Never. Never.&lt;br /&gt;
I should like to give you a hand.&lt;br /&gt;
I need a hand.&lt;br /&gt;
I am helpless.&lt;br /&gt;
I am strong.&lt;br /&gt;
You are my undoing.&lt;br /&gt;
Let go of me.&lt;br /&gt;
You are mine!&lt;br /&gt;
I am vulnerable.&lt;br /&gt;
I am beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;

I am the courier who brings Jesus back to life.&lt;br /&gt;
Is that really happening?&lt;br /&gt;
I am the whip that drives out demons.&lt;br /&gt;
Are you a prophet?&lt;br /&gt;
I am the lamp that shines a thousand new candles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can live in a house of illusions, you can have a house of dreams, you can have a garden of illusions, and all you have to worry about is who’s watching.&lt;br /&gt;
So this is how it all began.&lt;br /&gt;
You’re still here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dessert!&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll have orange juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’d better go. I can’t stay.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll see you later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They start having sex again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday to you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t you start dancing, dance with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Greek they say that heaven is on earth and that hell is in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heaven is in the sky; hell is on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you realize what you’ve done?&lt;br /&gt;
What I’ve done is damn dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is not far from here.&lt;br /&gt;
Dangerous what?&lt;br /&gt;
Dangerous to my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about two people, my lover and I.&lt;br /&gt;
He’s dead, but I have a gift. I can restore him to his true form, to his old size, his former glow.&lt;br /&gt;
I dream that on a clear day you and I, dressed in white, kneel before an oak and offer our services as acolytes to the new oak.&lt;br /&gt;
Will you accept our offering?&lt;br /&gt;
Will you believe me when I tell you I can restore my beloved to his former size, his former glow?&lt;br /&gt;
I look around me, and my hope is that you’ll accept my challenge and not resist my call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you?&lt;br /&gt;
Are you ready?&lt;br /&gt;
As the old oak is at rest, raise your hand.&lt;br /&gt;
Are you willing to offer your services as acolytes to the new oak?&lt;br /&gt;
As an anthemic chorus.&lt;br /&gt;
Dance the part! Hurry, the work is not yet done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovers, let us pray.&lt;br /&gt;
As the anthems have passed, so will our passion. Let us humbly offer our services to the new oak as he himself humbly requests our favor.&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s say you’re an anthemic chorus. You’ve spent a lifetime perfecting your melodies; now it’s your turn to give them a new life through the power of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can almost smell the old oak in that one. Let’s say your anthems have all the passion of a lake, their melodies as sweet as honey.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, I’d love to sing them.&lt;br /&gt;
I’d love to dance with them.&lt;br /&gt;
They’d love to see me dance with them.&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 99 The Straight World</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-099"/>
   <updated>2022-06-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-099</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about my ultimate fantasy. My fates have aligned so perfectly that I am able to travel between the worlds and realities of both men. And, boy, have my travels enthralled me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, sometimes I get so worked up thinking about all the heterosexual couches and booths and waitresses at Studley’s and All-American Express that I can’t wait until my next vacation to burn those down! When I travel, I want to see Donna Reed in a Cathysick Gone Girl tuxedo and Matthew McConaughey in Under the Skin. I want to see Jamey Rodewald in Under Siege. I want to experience all the ick that comes with taking a dump in a public place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boy! The straight world has perverted me beyond belief! They let those sissy bags float down the highway and they think they’re cruising when they’re really delivering packages of joy and love!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, I thought I’d stop by the Men’s Room to chat with some of the Breeders myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey! How ya doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! Threshold, I finally made it into the straight world. All I had to do was learn my place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still couldn’t tell me anything about your travels, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, since I moved here, I haven’t had the time to sit back and soak up all the ick that’s been churning around. See, I was living in the boondocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you moved here and all of a sudden you’re cruising the gay bars and cruising the cruising!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dude, we were so gay in this film, so gay!” While it is comforting to know that the dudes understand that they were participating in a queer universe, the DVD makes clear that this was a temporary state of affairs and that both dudes are now safely secured for and by the heterosexual matrix. So while the film’s queerness cannot be located at the level of identity, we can argue for queerness as a set of spatialized relations that are permitted through the white male’s stupidity, his disorientation in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 98 Total Recall</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about my ultimate fantasy. I was thirteen when I discovered Total Recall. I remember being in the coffee shop one day, and all of a sudden the coffee was empty and the only thing around was a half-naked man in a pajama top. And there was this other guy sitting there too, and he wasn’t naked either. And he had these animal-shaped eyes, and he wasn’t human either. And they weren’t talking to each other, either. And there wasn’t even a fucking car. And there wasn’t even any coffee in the cup. And I just freaked out and freaked out real bad. And I started crying because there were no buttons on the cups or on the tops of the trays. And I started putting my things away and heading back inside. And the next day, after I had calmed down a bit, I went back inside and bought all my clothes off the list and threw them in the washing machine. Do you have any idea how many times I got told that this was a fantasy when I was thirteen? And that scared the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dude, we were so gay in this film, so gay!” While it is comforting to know that the dudes understand that they were participating in a queer universe, the DVD makes clear that this was a temporary state of affairs and that both dudes are now safely secured for and by the heterosexual matrix. So while the film’s queerness cannot be located at the level of identity, we can argue for queerness as a set of spatialized relations that are permitted through the white male’s stupidity, his disorientation in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kmart has added Women’s Liberation Day to their calendar. And I have my reasons. For one, it’s blatantly obvious that they don’t want you guys to feel left out. For two, even if they don’t want to acknowledge your existence, they’re happy to promote your garbage. And, most galling of all, they’re happy to sell you calendars with messages like, “Join us next year!” And, most galling of all, they’ll throw in a free beer on the first anniversary.

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 96 Non-Macho Woman</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Fantasies can be very powerful. That is not to say that no man has had one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a queer woman I often believed that even in my professional life I would never be wanted by men. Until I came out. And one night, out of nowhere, I was sitting in a coffee shop with a friend and we were discussing the evils of war. Prior to that, our only exposure to the world of sex and violence was in the porno and gory movies. We decided to stop watching those and start reading books like Up to No Good by Kitty Cochrane. Suddenly I was in a conversation I had long ago stopped having with myself. Suddenly I was surrounded by men with guns. I turned and ran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men, my men, willing me into their arms and throwing coffee on my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night I did not leave. I stayed. For the rest of my life that is what I will be called when I am finished. I will be beaten, tortured, raped, and my friends left to gawk at the mutilated corpses. I went back to the cabin and soaked in the fire. I could not sleep. I dove into a deep sleep. When I awoke there was a man standing before me.
Gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had on a tuxedo, I cannot remember what his name was. I could recognize his features now. A soft smile plastered his features, the same smile that he gave me when we first met. A finger went up my shirt, feeling me up. Pulling it down, he removed his gloves and played with my buttons. For a moment, I thought I had gotten away with it. But as he began to undo my fly buttons, he said, I wonder if you ever wore a bra. I took it off. I wasn’t upset. I wasn’t surprised. I couldn’t tell you. But it was something. Now, back where we started. A hand moved up and down between us, up and down, never speaking or moving from where we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never did like sex with a man. I hated intimacy. But that night he asked me to take off all my clothes. All my make-up, make-up that would cover my breasts and underarm. And he put his cock in my mouth. And I did as he told me. I told him how embarrassed I was, how I had been the only non-macho woman at the party. I told him I could take care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, I share a number of stories from my experiences of becoming-queer, of methodological anarchism. these stories are not true, for I am in agreement with the notion that there is ‘no such thing as a true story’. Nor do they follow a single line of direction or desire; they connect to each other in many ways. they form a rhizome. In sharing these stories, I do not have a simple message or a particular argument to convey. Like Ursula Le Guin, ‘I wish, instead of looking for a message when we read a story, we could think, “Here’s a door opening on a new world: what will I find there?”’&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 95 Divine Love</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I have spent the last sixteen years of my life pretending to be a woman. During that time, I was cast in this role through a process of emotional reclamation. I believed I could please no one, not my parents, not the law, not the world. I could be whoever I wanted to be and I never once regretted it. I became a priestess, a nurse, a nun, a mason, a teacher, an altar server in a number of different orders. I walked down the street one day and no one said anything to me. One week I was a teacher and the next I was a prostitute. Then I left the profession and went back to being a prostitute. I never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always believed in following my heart. I know that no matter how many times I take pills, no matter how many times I take injections, that I will always be attracted to the beautiful woman in me. And although it is within my power to deny this to her, I refuse to allow it to stop me from loving her. My quest for divine love has driven me to the brink of insanity. I have no shame. I do not hide my junk in my underwear drawer, I do not stash my valuables in my bathroom cupboard. All of this is so that I may one day set loose this curse on this world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 94 The Mountain</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It is not a pipe dream. There is a mountain in the Andes Mountains, way up there, well-known ascents and descends, and on top of that mountain a woman. She is flawless, without flaw. She has the strength of will, the grace of chariots, and the will to conquer. She is me, me with my head held high, me heading to a better place in life. My goal in life is to conquer her, and when I do, my heart will melt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about that mountain. That’s right. The real magic happens at the top of that mountain. You see, at that top, there is a vacuum. The air is rich with the scent of urine, and the taste of it. And in that vacuum is the chakra, the center of the human body. It is from that chakra that all the other sexual needs, including reproduction, are derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a bucket in your hand, big enough for half a cheesecake and big enough for a dick. Imagine a dick up there, a snow-white schlong, with two fingers that look like fucking fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you get that cheesecake from the bakery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there might be some secret handshake involved, but I’m telling you now, that’s how you get that dildo up there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 93 Garden of Fuck</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. This is not a story about coming out or coming out late. I never came out. One night, at the age of twelve, I came out. I did not know it. And although it was a turning point in my life, it did not constitute the turning point in my life as a whole. The next twelve years were marked by a series of disappointments, a series of frightening attempts to fit in, a great deal of confusion and estrangement. At last, in the summer of ‘89, I came out. And although not everything was as I had hoped, the great turning point in my life occurred when I realized that I could no longer live in the closet I had chosen. It was then that I knew I had chosen the right way. And I am eternally grateful to H.G. Wells for that revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a homosexual. Yes. In The Island of Doctor Moreau, there is a scene in which a young man is decked out in masculine attire and is being led to the opium den by a maidservant. The scene is a perfect allegory of modern-day living, in which the heroic individual alliance between man and man can no longer be denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fantasy. What I mean by that is that what I have chosen to be, or try to be, is not the same thing as what I am. My heterosexuality has never allowed me to completely separate what I consider my true self from what I call my fantasy, or what I would like to be called if I were able to face the enormous challenge of becoming a person of authentic gay identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I can’t tell you the joy of discovery! In my early thirties, I began fooling around with other men. Even at the age of sixteen, I was still attracted to girls. At first, it was fun. When we first hooked up, it was purely an excuse to get laid. But as our relationship developed, and particularly after I graduated from college, it became more than just an excuse. We spent nights cruising the gay-girl websites, watching videos in which young boys performed sexual acts on college-aged girls. Soon we found that the teenage boys in our group of friends were not only monogamous, they were also sexually adventurous as men. Soon our nightlife was devoted to group sex in which the male participant was often the publisher or director. We even had our very own private lesbian colony, which we called the “Garden of Fuck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was there that I first experienced what Dale and I affectionately refer to as the garden, in which, for the first time in my life I was exposed to the joys of sex and nonsexuality. Although, admittedly, we were still somewhat in the dark about the real-life risks involved. Fortunately, our home life was so filled with mature conversation that we were able to adjust to the “Wild, Wild West” atmosphere of the affair without becoming instantly paranoid. At the same time, our sense of adventure was growing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 92 Banana Split</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-092"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins innocently enough. I was fifteen. I had just come in from an all-night cram school for gifted children in Columbus, Georgia. At breakfast I ordered a banana split with extra coconut shreds. As I was finishing my banana split I looked at my plate. I noticed a small, semi-circular object in the middle of the split. Immediately I knew what it was. I picked it up, marveling at the shape, and then immediately, without thinking, I removed it from my plate and ate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine months later, I was in the kitchen of a motel in McKinney, Texas. I had just gotten in from a four-day clinic in Arizona and was on my way back to the town of Tyler, where I was to attend my junior year of high school. As I made my way to the lobby to pay the bill, I noticed two gentlemen waiting for me. As I passed by, passing them, I noticed they were both beginning to laugh. I turned and, noticing they were all wearing dark suits, I asked who they were. Immediately they recognized me as the gay student who had just been beaten up. As I passed them again, another gentleman asked who I was. Immediately I understood. I was in the process of becoming famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I found out that my story had gone viral and was being read by millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, my mother, who had known me since I was four, called me into her office. She was a registered nurse and not exactly tech savvy, but she knew a story when she saw one. She said that in the third grade, when I came down with a cold, my mother took me to a doctor and asked him which shampoo to use. The doctor told her he did not know, of course, and she asked him what brand. He told her Tide, of course. Her eyes lit up. She asked him to describe her. He told her she looked like a swimming pool, big and blue, with sparkly sparkles that matched the blue of her skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother was speechless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful sentiment, sweet and simple yet powerful. A sentiment that still rings true for me and so many others who suffer through the shame of our sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother looked at me with such pity. I knew the shame I carried inside me. I knew I could never be like her. She looked at me, smiled, and asked me if I wanted coffee. I told her no. She then asked me if I wanted lemon Coke. I told her no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I turn my back to walk across the platform. And suddenly a figure in the mist appears before me. It is… A WOMAN!! Her face is torn and bloody. She has large blotches of blood all over her body. She is covered in what appears to be pubic hair. She is covered in what appears to be a church. Her breasts have also been ripped off. She has a large gnarled tree growing out of her back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize this figure! She has a singular red poof on her forehead, which turns into a round white head as it drips out several red droplets. In this final projection, the fog has lifted, revealing that this is the loveliest woman on earth!! And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the figure turns and vanishes into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 90 Anovulation</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I am a gorgeous young woman in a sea of menopause. As I approach menopause, I become incredibly feminine. Soon I will have no menopause, and I will look like a young Donna Tartt. Soon my hair will have fallen out and I will have thick, wavy hair that I can grow out as many braids as I want. Soon I will be known by my thick hair that hangs down to my ankles and drapes my figure in matching evening gowns. Soon I will be able to turn on an overhead light and be recognized by thousands of people waiting to see me. In this manner, I can become beautiful, long live my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have practiced these actions on myself and have found that, when I do them, my clitoris turns from one end of the penis to the other in a rhythmic dance. I call it anovulation. All of this may sound very dramatic, and it is, but it is also possible for me to be truly satisfied. I have found that, in order to be satisfied, I have to have something to hide. Desire turns to insatiable. The more I hide, the more I want. This is why I hang on. Look closely. My skin has begun to turn golden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sharing these stories, I do not have a simple message or a particular argument to convey. Like Ursula Le Guin, I wish, instead of looking for a message when we read a story, instead of looking up, we could think about the words, the sounds, the smells that emanate from a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, I share a number of stories from my experiences of becoming-queer, of methodological anarchism. these stories are not true, for I am in agreement with the notion that there is ‘no such thing as a true story’. Nor do they follow a single line of direction or desire; they connect to each other in many ways. they form a rhizome. In sharing these stories, I do not have a simple message or a particular argument to convey. Like Ursula Le Guin, ‘I wish, instead of looking for a message when we read a story, we could think, “Here’s a door opening on a new world: what will I find there?”’&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I have this island up there in the Atlantic Ocean, and up there I will sail my lover, my white Antarctic wanderer in a drift along the beach, and we will both be safe from the elements and from the elements’ mirrors and will be free of the elements as much as the elements will be free of us. We will both be safe from the elements because I will be protected by the elements and because the safety I will enjoy will be directly dependent on the safety of my lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine me up there on that rock watching the sunset and saying to myself, “That was worth it,” or do you want me up there on that sand in the surf, saying to myself, “Just because I smell fish doesn’t make me a fisher,” or do you want me up there in a cabin up there on a tree with a log sticking out of my chest and having sex with the world around us, with the coconut trees and the palms and the wildflowers drifting in the breeze?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because I like to imagine it. I want to sail down that beach one day and not be afraid at all. I want to have my cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 88 Good Little Sissy</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had a childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful childhood. My childhood was filled with fairy tales, unicorns, princesses, and stelettes. It was all so very exciting and yet utterly terrifying. The land was lush and the trees were red and the sky blue. There was a cottage nearby that we called the Well of the Fairy Godmother. It was a spring wonderland and the spring blossomed so thick and the air so rich with promise that it seemed the very heavens themselves were calling us home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up believing that fairy tales were just a bunch of pretty stories that children told to frighten themselves into sleeping through school. It was a constant battle to keep my mind off the white noise of nursery rhymes and Hello Kitty greeting cards. As I got older I began to question everything I had been taught, from Winnie the Pooh to the value of Chantal from Les Miserables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year was 1952. Les Miserables had just come out, and it was at this exact moment that I decided that I had enough of being a “good little sissy” and left school. Les Miserables is a movie about two spoiled young ladies, and the plot is incredibly melodramatic, weaving in and out of love triangles, betrayals, reconciliations, and downright betrayals. I had never considered it, until that moment, that there was any heterosexual in it. At that moment, fairy tales and feminism hit a wall. Fairy tales were so very feminine. They were so much in control. Feminism was all about women being leaders, having their say, being heard. I could no longer sit and watch Beauty and the Beast. There was something so wrong with the way I was being taught and it hit me. I had been dabbling in lesbianism for quite some time. I had become enamored with Beulah, the spoiled little fairy who spoiled everything. I was a rotten little sissy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I want to be able to go into a gay bar and walk right into the lover’s room and be met by a man and a woman engaged in what may be heterosexual intercourse. There, in the privacy of my own mind, I can compare notes on his or her bodily functions and surmise, without judgement or guilt, based on the physical evidence, whether or not they are truly homosexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, in a heterosexual bar I could be cuddled and comforted by my best friend’s father, by my lover’s mother, by my best friend’s lover, by my onetime best friend’s lover, by a married couple engaged in passionate loving making, or by a gay couple in a committed relationship. Or, I could be led on a wild goose chase by a handsome stranger who believes that he or she is in love with me and may, if I offered him the opportunity, penetrate my very being with his or her own penis.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It is to have a yacht up above the yacht club, in the Bermuda Triangle, cruising the Great Lakes, New England, up to the Massachusetts Bay, and down to Randolph County, Virginia where, one afternoon, the manager will let all the girls into his yacht club and lead them nude up to the balcony where he will set up his jacuzzi, and from there they can all masturbate together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will spend the rest of my life climbing aboard those twenty-foot yacht rowing boats and watching the men fuck. A man could take my picture and I would not object. Picture it. A naked man climbs aboard a yacht up the Great Lakes to watch men fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sodomy is bad, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s warfare. When the men are drunk and high, when they have no inhibitions, they get wild, they get rough. That’s when they fuck. That’s what they do. They fuck, baby. It’s a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what I believe in. I believe in having a constructive dialogue about sex. Sex is a game. A game. You win when one person or a small group of people acts in a way that is positively constructive and that is good for the overall health and happiness of the whole community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the original sin was being gay, I believed that it was cast off long ago. I no longer believe that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 85 In Our Own Backyard</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-085"/>
   <updated>2022-05-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-085</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Queer theory and practice have come a long way in the past thirty years, but where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look to the future, I think many of us would do well to remember that we are a long way from where we started. I am hopeful that we will continue to build queer theory and praxis into bodies of work that can be put into practice. But first we have to make some hard decisions. Can we continue to marginalize those of us who are queer? Can we continue to deny the very possibility of queers being anything more than what we are? I worry that our very raison d’tre may be political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we still love? I keep seeing my mother dressed up as Lady MacBeth. I keep seeing the ritual in my church of burlesque performances and masquerades. I am left wondering, Who is this woman masquerading as me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go back to the days when Lady Chatterley was Queen. Let’s face it, there’s nothing sexy about being a queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, queers aren’t sexy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are aspects of queer life that I absolutely loathe. For instance, in my experience, the queens that I admire most in burlesque are queens in name only. They’re effeminate, gluttonous, and frankly, downright dangerous. My sense is that many of the men who put on the show don’t even want to be queens, much less be in love with the women on the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’ve all been brainwashed into thinking that the only reason a certain queer group of folks might want to dress up as a certain image of a certain gender, or even certain bodily part of a certain body, is that it might please a certain white, heterosexual man. It’s not at all what I believe about queers; it’s just not something that appeals to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just might be one of those men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, what I am most frightened of is that within our very own borders. There, in our own backyard, we can all get it on. We can all get it on in front of a live audience. One night, maybe not even in front of a live audience, but somewhere between the casting couch and the punch line, a live queer can put her cards on the table and announce that she’s a lesbian, and the house will come to know just what kind of home they’ve lost. It could be a Randy Orton moment, and it would be wonderful. I would want it. I do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 83 Unnaturally Sexual</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I want to have my entire being, my very being, squirmed out of me so that I am as phallic as possible. Please listen carefully. I want to squirm as far as I can in a pair of latex stockings that have been sewn together. I want to squirm inside a toilet seat made from a pair of bathtub sleeves. In this state, I am at my most unnaturally sexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me ask you this final question: Who do you think has the right to squirm the most in a place of public humiliation? And most important, who do you think has the right to urinate on my body?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody has to see me squatting in a pair of bathtubs or my shapely butt cheeks jutting out from a tight fit of tight pants. Nobody has to hear me wail in frustration at having to share a toilet with a ditzy teen-ager. Nobody has to see me put on make-up that barely covered my round ass and swollen tits and tell me that I look sissy for wearing a sundress. Nobody has to listen to me describe the humiliation I face when I have to share a public place with an eager group of gawkers. Nobody has to know how humiliated I am to know that it is my right to squirm as I please, as long as it does not put me in the same class with those queers who want to shove me down a well. That is my story, my tribute to the theater of the absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 82 Anais Nin</title>

   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-082</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. According to my theory, it is in the very act of desire that an individual acquires their being. Once an individual has reached a certain point of satisfaction in a given situation, their being as a being is transformed into a state of being or an aspect of being. In other words, as Anais Nin asks, is my being another’s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may paraphrase Raymond Williams, satisfaction as such is an illusion. Satisfaction is not a state of being at which something real may be said to have been attained. To paraphrase Murray Bookchin, what we might call the ‘pleasure principle,’ if we will, is a lie. It is not a truth. In order to be a thing, something has to be real. Which is to say, what we might call the capacity to be something or to be said to have something at a given moment in time. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the fulfillment of a quest or the practice of a sport or the satisfaction of an emotional need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as we allow for the the word ‘pleasure’ to ring hollow, it is possible to miss the central point about which Williams speaks: satisfaction as such is an illusion. We may think that satisfaction is a transitory state, a correlate of something more or less real, but it is not truth. The more abstract a subject is to reality, the less real it seems to us. Thus it is with the very essence of the queer theory of sexuality as it stands. The more generalized a subject is to being, the less generalized it seems to us. We might think that when someone wants to do something, they really mean something or that it is possible to truly experience something when they do it, but it is not so. When I lay down a song on a piano and it really does bring tears to my eyes or when my mother has asked me to dance with her in a public place, I take them for granted. What I really want is to be free of her. I want to experience her fully as she really is. And in doing so, I deny myself the very thing I desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Anais Nin this is the abyss. The ecstasy of her early years in a communal brothel, the ecstasy of lasciviousness that swelled to ecstatic black-and-blue when her father died, washed over her by the flash of a blinding conflagration at the end of The Golden Compass. Here in the arms of her lover, Arthur, she finds the ideal road to the Other, where distortion and negation no longer seem questions of right and wrong but of becoming. But why let this tragedy cloud her joy? The nights spent in lavatories, the months spent in brothels, the years spent in refining her sensual gift; they are what Anais calls the compensations. They are compensations for what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Arthur, the ideal of Sodom and Gomorra, a harsh reality so fearsome it could tear a man limb from limb. But Anais, Sodom and Gomorra is only the first phase of the overall adventure. In the midst of these compensations, in the arms of Arthur and Sodom, where she finds the ideal of Absence, Anais senses a fiercer desire still more terrible than before. Where before there was perhaps the faintest glimmer of hope, here the ardor is unquenched. She cannot remain Sodom and Gomorra. She cannot remain in the arms of Arthur and Absence. And as for the lovers, they too must leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this ideal that Anais needs to conquer in order to be herself. In order to become what she must be. Absence is not an alternative. None of us comes close to the experience of love that comes from being alone. It is one of the most profound, rewarding, innermost human needs that we as a species have yet to fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 81 Lost Cities</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-081"/>
   <updated>2022-05-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-081</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, fantasy. It has nothing to do with whether you are heterosexual or homosexual. If you can keep it up long enough, I’ll be able to keep up with you. So let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My specialty is the disappearing. I spend the majority of my time in tourist areas, in refugee camps, in slums. I like to travel the world, and I think that the world should be my world. I think it should be possible for ordinary people to experience the world in a different way from the one we’ve been taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the world has changed so much that it’s no longer what it was. Traditional values no longer apply. We have no values left. All we have is sex. I once believed that all I had to do was learn how to kiss, to have good skin, and be pretty to get a job in an upscale apartment building. Now, I wonder if maybe that’s what I was taught. Maybe it was all part of the price of being a good Indian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, my specialty is in the areas of “Lost Cities.” These days, the main tourist spots are Bangkok and Durban. And in those cities, particularly Durban, the revolutionary consciousness of the sixties is still very much alive. People still revere the old king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the most striking things about cities. People still have their houses. They still have their livestock. They still have their values. Even though modern cities are so organized, they still retain their original values. The peasants still have their land. Traditional values still hold true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went there once. There was a big party. Everybody was dressed in green, and there were thousands of people. Suddenly, there were wild fires burning in the sky. Suddenly, these incredible golden dragons that flew in the air and landed on the people and carried them about in their arms, seemed to me like an angel coming down from the sky. And I thought to myself, “Now, that’s how powerful these elements are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that these elements are also the vehicles for the reconstitution of the social order. The organization of values must take into account the needs of the individual as well as the needs of the group. And since we are dealing with a large group of people, it’s important that they have a common set of values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the organization of values has the greatest significance. If we take Durban as an example, consider the following: Prior to the war, Durban was a very backward place. Prior to the war, it was practically unknown to the English. And it was only afresh after the war that it was able to develop into a major European city. The cities of Europe after the war were much more developed. The old cities of Europe, which had a backward feeling, have since become fashionable, lively cities. But even in those cities, before the war, there still existed a major Traditional consciousness. Traditional values were really not so important. Today, all that’s left are the values of the International Brigades, the C.I.A. and the like. And even here there are still major Traditional values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello?… That woman in front of me, she’s a member of the International Brigades?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C.I.A. has a very important function in Africa. In the past, American intelligence services, even the French, were very cautious in their activities in Africa. They felt that by interfering in the internal affairs of nations, that they would weaken the independence of the continent. But today, Washington doesn’t hesitate to send its best agents into countries to overthrow the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with.

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 80 The Zoos</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My fantasy is that I will be a part of a queer family. My family will be the Zoos, my family will be exotic, mysterious, sexual, smart, beautiful, long lived and, most of all, they will all love me just the same. My family will be simple, straightforward, kind, accepting, giving, brilliant, wise. I will be safe, I will be loved, and my family will be heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you what I think will happen. First there will be no horses. Then there will be no visitors. Then there will be no zoos. Then I, you, will have to find our way together in a world of our own. It may seem that way at first, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that it’s not at all what I want. I also realize that it is not what many others want. I see my dream as a call to arms. Let us all rally around the Princess. Let us join together to rescue her from the evil clutches of the mansplainer and his syphilitic slave. Let us join together to free ourselves from the yoke of ignorance and bijection and return to the matre d’ and laissez faire idealism that made America what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 79 Queer Geographer</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-079"/>
   <updated>2022-05-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-079</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My ideal scenario is that one day all of us will be able to look up and see only a sky so vast, so vast that it encompasses the entire known universe. And there, on that brilliant white backdrop, will be no men, no men at work in the offices of big corporations, no men at home in the beds of happily married women. There will be no men at work in the homes of white middle-class families, no men at home among the artists and the cubicle-dwelling scientists. And just beyond that backdrop will be a vast expanse of unspoiled beauty, unspoiled splendor, and that one simple word, love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat that one more time. Imagine the beauty and splendor of that beyond that backdrop, that beyond the nearly-hexagonal city-state of San Francisco, where I now live and work. Could you imagine the splendor and beauty of that beyond that backdrop, and beyond me, the nearly-homeless, nearly-impotent gay who craves love and fulfillment but fears the judgment of those they love, and fears judgment them self? Could you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a world out there, and it is not for us to explore it. It is not even for us to create it. We may not want to. And the very act of exploring that vast expanse can leave us breathless and ask the most basic question of our very being: Where am I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are one of those who have tried to live our lives boldly, truthfully, and joyously. You have boldly taken up arms against the repressive forces that have attempted to silence you. You have stood boldly for what you believe in, what you are, and what you aspire to be. You have rejected the status quo and embraced the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the repressive forces that you have worked so hard to build up against you can now batter you down with a combination of ignorance, fear, and spite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know that in some parts of the world, people still burn to death simply for being gay? There are countries where you can be executed simply for being gay. And there are countries where you can be tortured to death simply for being gay. In such places, what choice do we people have? Are we willing to be killed simply for who we are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may be frank with you, I do not believe that queers are necessarily evil. And what does it mean for us to be considered “good” or “morally upright”? Are we deemed virtuous simply for what we choose to do or who we are? Is it not something that we, as queer people, actively work against?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that it is more than just our choice, more than just our desire that drives us forward. And it is we who, through our choice, do truly create our own destiny. There is a vortex running through our very being. I am sure you have felt it. As I have, Queer Geographer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 78 Red Waterfall</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-078"/>
   <updated>2022-05-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-078</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I have a beautiful red waterfall in the middle of a peaceful meadow. There is a clearing in the middle of the clearing where the three hundred laurel wreaths are set. And in the middle of the clearing there is a basin, and in the middle of the water there is a pedestal. And at the top of the pedestal is a golden crozier. And it is said that the powers that be at Disneyland will come and take one look at that and say, “That’s a boy! That’s a boy!” and wonder, “Is that really him? Or is that really him sitting there doing the dishes? No. That’s really him mounted on top of a unicorn, and he’s taking orders!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me show you my idealized version of that red waterfall. Imagine that I am you. You are twenty-three years old, with an easygoing personality, a sense of humor, and an eager appetite for physical fulfillment. You are conscientious and competitive, but above all you are devoted. You have a beautiful sense of humor, which allows you to turn your intense needs into playthings. You are outgoing and curious, always ready for a conversation to end. You are sexually naive, but only just now do you have the curiosity to try things out on someone else. You are insecure and frightened, but above all you are wild. You float your idealized fantasy of the life you want to lead on the back of a unicorn. I have chosen you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have talked about you a little, let’s talk about you being gay. Let’s start with the physical aspect. I have never been so sure of a person’s sexual attraction than I was when I was in high school. It was all so new to me. There was no such thing as premarital sex, no such thing as a gray area about which one could safely say or do something. It was all so murky. In those days, even talking about sex was considered wicked. At that time, no one was safe from the judgment of anyone in their bed. I remember once blurting out to a group of eighth graders, who had just learned about AIDS, that I had tested positive for AIDS. Not one bead of sweat separated me from the rest of the group. No one could stand up to me. Imagine my surprise when, the next day, I found that every single one of my classmates, male and female, openly acknowledged my diagnosis. And no, it wasn’t because one of the boys mentioned my sexual abstinence. No, it wasn’t because one of the girls proudly announced that she’d had sex with a boy just a few weeks earlier. No, it wasn’t even because one of the older boys volunteered to have sex with me. Instead, it was the simple act of being gay that got them all riled up. Imagine my relief when, the next day, the Principal of that very high school came crawling out of her classroom to offer me her resignation. I was dumbfounded. For the first time in my life I understood why people hated me. I was finally being believed.&lt;/p&gt;

I would have spectacular lighting that would never fail to thrill. I would have balconies that spanned the infinity, I would have arches that crisscrossed the nights in a dance floor. I would have ceiling fans that would blow in the wind and whirl in the air, and I would have machinery that would churn out performers that would never fail to thrill. I would have machinery that would melt away the walls of the nightclub in favor of me, me and my show. I would have machinery that would give shape to the night as I saw it, and I would have the means to shape it, to transform it, and I would have the means to leave the world as I knew it.

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 76 NuANCE</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-076"/>
   <updated>2022-05-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-076</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It is this and I will float free, eternally, as an island of my own made up of male and female fantasies. And you will never know what it is like to be with me or the others who call this place home, because no one has dared to ask such a simple yet profound question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child I used to spend all my time in libraries, on bookshelves, frolicking among the piles of manuscripts. And one day I came across a title that immediately caught my attention. It was a book by a famous French scientist on nuclear fission. It was called Man’s Search for Meaning. In it, the author, an internationally famous scientist, compared the search we make for meaning in our daily lives to the search we make for meaning in the nuclear bomb. He then went on to describe the ecstatic feelings he got when he read the words “To beam, to shine” in the nuclear fission report. He called them the “anaerobic fissures of meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suddenly had a surge of hope. I knew what he meant. I had felt it with so many people I knew, with so much of what so many of us struggle everyday to understand. I vowed to myself never to give up on anyone and set out on a quest to understand myself. I have since come to realize that there is something called “NuANCE,” something we can all identify with, something that is core to who we are. I have found it, and I call it my “pleasure center.” And in my quest I have come across a book that changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer Pleasure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who are truly curious and driven can discover our own joys and perils by simply following the examples set by those around us. That’s what queer pleasure is all about.
You see, I was not the only one. Other students told me they felt the same way as I did. They said that they too often felt they were on the periphery of the college experience, caught in the vortex of the heterosexual conversation. They said that they felt pressured to present a “queer” image that would that would further alienate those of us who might otherwise…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear about something. I have never pressured anyone to present a queer image. And in fact, there are very good reasons to encourage those of us who do choose to bequeath that image. As Stonewall’s famous saying goes, there are no blinders on. We, as educators, are answerable to the people we serve. We must not only educate the next generation of leaders in our fields, we must also inspire the very essence of their very being. As Harvey Milk said, the values we teach are not simply labels on a piece of paper. They are the very very very essence of who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I refuse to be labeled by anybody!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not your enemy. I am your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last remark was just the clearest sign that someone was listening. For the next twenty minutes, each of us took turns recounting the life lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 75 Magic Carpet of Love</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. It is the kind of fantasy that leads me to believe that the very basis of all reality is a magic carpet of love and desire that is pulled in a million directions at once, weaving us into a tapestry that we can unravel and add to at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carpet of love is so thick and so rich that it encompasses the infinite splendor of all things, and it is here that I find the secret of my power. I’m talking about the inner being that is the center of the universe, the Supreme Being. That’s right. Imagine your inner being is a perfectly ordinary little man, about your size, pretty, good at sports, dull, but infinitely loving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you squint hard enough, you can see that his bedroom walls are lined with photographs of perfectly ordinary people he has slept with. He calls them friends. He calls them family. He has them over for dinner, brings gifts, takes vacations, holds concerts, cooks for the group, cleans up after themselves, holds seminars, teaches classes, runs the house, and does almost anything to please them all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 74 Oxytocin Dream</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-074"/>
   <updated>2022-05-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-074</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I have a fantasy in which I am one of three human beings with the same sex who have just had a marvelous sexual experience. I call it an “Oxytocin Dream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mean, are we talking about a surge of epinephrine coursing through my body, a kind of high that puts me in a pleasant stupor and puts out a forest of lights?
An epinephrine surge! Then, the most wonderful thing happens. I become a nonhuman being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonhuman being?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.k.a. feeling okay as long as it’s not too hot. Then it’s time for bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you tell me what an epinephrine surge is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I do, will you please leave me alone? I never want to have to explain it again.
You want an epinephrine surge? Epinephrine is the brain’s “happy glue.” Epinephrine floods the brain with epinephrine, creating a kind of a high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really not feeling so hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the brain make such a great supply of epinephrine? Are you tense? Are you in a daze? Have your eyes been puffy or have your irises popped out? Put on your oxygen mask and strap on your epinephrine. You and your lover are going to need it. The brain may even swell to accommodate the surge, creating a kind of a second heart. The second heart will pump the bloodstream with lots of epinephrine, keeping you alert and warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get down to brass tacks. Are your nipples hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m telling you, they are hard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want epinephrias? Epinephrine floods the brain with epinephrine, creating a kind of a hard lump. You want a real epinephrine high? Imagine my joy! Epinephrine floods the brain with epinephrine, creating a kind of a brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stuff is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get down to brass tacks. Is your penis stiff or has it become hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How come? Are you on medication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My insurance company will deny my bisexuality claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m not the only one. Several prominent psychologists have come out against same-sex attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so frightened! This is killing me. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is your problem, not theirs. Here are a few suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;
Stop masturbating.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop saying you want to.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop using words like “orientation” and even the feminine “bi” in your sex-positive marketing.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop wearing sensible make-up and stop acting like you have any sex drive at all.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop eating junk food and drink lots of water.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop having casual sex.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop wearing tight clothing.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop letting your hair grow out.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop laughing when you see people in gay porn.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop using the word “gay” in your sex-positive marketing.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop using the word “lesbian,” “gay,” or even the generic “faggot” in your messages.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop trying to change the world by becoming president of the American Psychological Association.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop being a good mother.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop being a good friend.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop feeling guilty if your lover doesn’t want to see you anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop enjoying yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crappy brain cells don’t help matters, do they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry. I’m here to help.&lt;br /&gt;
… but first, you’ll have to relax.&lt;br /&gt;
Are you all right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice bump. That’s better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 73 Total Liberation</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-073"/>
   <updated>2022-05-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-073</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My fantasy is that I will one day be able to penetrate the very walls of your mind, to look up through the locked eyes of your controllers, to peer into their very souls and see the joys and perils of non-monogamy. And that is possible only with the full participation of the whole body.
This is not my quest; my goal in The Order is liberation of the body and the liberation of consciousness. My goal is total liberation of the body and the complete lack of subjectivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you realize what you are doing?
What does it mean to be freed from subjectivation?
We can’t liberate the body if we don’t liberate subjectivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have said before, one of the ways that systems of oppression reinforce themselves is through the denial of freedom. I can’t go back in time and deny my sexual predation. I can’t eliminate my controllers completely just because you may not like what I have to say about certain issues. In order to effect change, we have to understand our historical contexts, our historical contexts in order to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, in order to effect change, we have to understand what it is that makes certain groups of people tick and which groups they must subordinate in order to be heard. We have to understand The Order in order to effect change. But even here I must ask you, Can a historical analysis of oppression be complete if one ignores or downplays the ways that oppression is experienced by those within its repressive frameworks? Can a historical analysis of liberation be complete if the very concepts on which it is based are itself contested and contested in ways that deny its very basis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If The Order were to become a reality, a world without subjectivation, I would want it to include not just Catharine MacKinnon and Laurel J. Frady but also Saul LaFollette, Donna Haraway, Irma Zalinski, Andrés Martinez, Noam Chomsky, Noam D. Gluck, Noam Heuser, Noam Heuser, Noam K. White, Noam Manes, Murray Bookchin, Noam N. Weiss, Noam Rosenberg, Noam S. Yudkowsky, Noam T. Wu, and Zbigniew Brzezin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 72 Queer Gestapo</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-072"/>
   <updated>2022-05-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-072</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound very exciting and counterintuitive to some, but if we are ever going to have a conversation about queer theory and practice it is imperative that we understand the theoretical terrain that allows for these very queer dreams to be realized. If we do not, we risk becoming like the Attis and Sodom and Gomorra of queer theory and practice. I want to tell you that as a queer theoretical biologist I am acutely aware of my theoretical limitations and am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to be able to advance queer theory and practice, we have to engage with the terrain of theoretical limitations. As such, I am acutely aware of my power and responsibility to make theoretical leaps, and I am cognizant of the ways in which, in order to make theoretical leaps, we have to give up on the terrain of theoretical limitations and act upon the terrain of our own dreams. But there is one more thing I must tell you. It is something that you must be very, very, very careful of. I want to talk to you about bifurcation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. If you divide queer theory into three broad camps then I think we can start really diving into some deep, meaningful ground cleaning that will hopefully lead to some really exciting new directions for queer theory and practice. So let’s start there. Let’s say we’re talking about three broad camps: Bifurcation, Queer Gestapo, and Main Stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this may seem a little overwhelming, a little overwhelming to some. I get that. Queer Studies is all about trying to unpack these big theoretical boxes and come up with practical ways to address those practicalities. I get that. I just feel that for queer theory to really progress it first has to address the needs of people outside its borders. I get that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Stream, on the other hand, I think has to start somewhere. Main Stream has to be more than just theoretical. Main Stream has to be about, among other things, the working class, the poor, the sick, the elderly, the unrepresented , the excluded, and the hopeless. Main Stream has to be able to say to those folks, “Hey, here’s what we’ve got here. You just keep dreaming big and we’ll get it.” I think Main Stream has to be able to say, “Now, before it’s too late, we’ve got you.” Because there have to be some rewards involved here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to move on from here. I think we both know that once you start talking about Main and/or Bifurcation, that the dog starts barking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Let’s say I want to talk to you about, well, Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the class struggle, liberation, and politics. Bifurcation is the historical moment when the terrain has shifted from the patois of the landed gentry into the terrain of popular consciousness and class struggle. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping if you will. Main and Bifurcation are quite different things. Main and Bifurcation are the struggle between the needs of the wimmin and the whimpering baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the historical moment when the working class, the underdogs, has finally gotten its shit together and gone mainstream. Now Main and Bifurcation are not overlapping. Main and Bifurcation are the limitations of Main and Bifurcation. Main and Bifurcation are just limitations on what can be said about Main and Bifurcation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well then Queer Studies, let’s say I’m talking to you about Main and Bifurcation. Now Main is the terrain, the terrain on which struggles take place. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are not abstractions to be toyed with. Here in the real world Main and Bifurcation are the concrete limitations of what can be said and done. Here in the real world, Main and Bifurcation are the very real, everyday battles being fought out in the streets, in the working class neighborhoods, up and down the social ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of all this, what do you do?
You retreat into the safe haven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 71 Blue Whale</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;
What would you like to say to someone who has never seen a blue whale?&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I don’t think that those twenty-five thousand people ever saw blue whales again. I think they just got fat with those kinds of animals. Now, I’m no expert on the subject,&lt;br /&gt;
But whales are large. They weigh hundreds of tons. And they take tens of thousands of years to grow to adult size. So maybe you and I could go back in time and go back in time and eat a baby whale.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s a mouthful.&lt;br /&gt;
Just let me finish.&lt;br /&gt;
Wait. I have something else to tell you. The blue whale has taken a virgin. Yes? What is it? You guessed it.&lt;br /&gt;
A doubloon.&lt;br /&gt;
A doubloon what, exactly?&lt;br /&gt;
A fertilized egg.&lt;br /&gt;
A fertilized egg. That’s what they’re called. Floating city eggs. You see, these things, these things we call “doubloons,” they’re not babies at all. They’re little round bastards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well then, lets make a baby.&lt;br /&gt;
Cut it in half lengthwise. One half is the embryo, the other the placenta. Now, take one end of the embryo and sew it round the outside of the olives. Then place the cut end under the broiler and roast for fifteen minutes, till golden brown. Then remove the broil and serve. Garnish with sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;
Well then, here’s the baby.&lt;br /&gt;
Dab some turpentine on the end so it glows.&lt;br /&gt;
Silk purse. Needle and thread.&lt;br /&gt;
A blue whale is so huge, you cant see its eyes. You can though you can’t quite see its mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
How huge is a blue whale?&lt;br /&gt;
Um, not a whole lot. A real pain in the ass to pull a blue whale.&lt;br /&gt;
Well now, you’ll never guess what it looks like.&lt;br /&gt;
A real pain in the ass to pull a blue whale.&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty-five thousand blue whales a day are killed in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 70 Disneyland Wedding</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.
I went to a retreat once in Florida, and the retreat house was in a little town just off the highway. It was called Disneyland. They had a really spectacular ride up there, and it was redecorated every night with stained glass windows that showed all the different fairy tales that had been made into the castle. And I got to go up there and look at the stained glass windows. And I was blown away. I mean, I’ve always been an outdoors person, but I had never seen stained glass windows until I went to Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roy, what would you like to say to someone who has never been to Disneyland?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guests. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you like to say to someone who has been to Disneyland but hasn’t been to a wedding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guests. Please. I remember five years ago I went to a wedding in Manhattan and there were twenty or thirty thousand people there. There was a reception, and it was just enormous, and there was a throne and a chair and a thousand flowers and everything. And I stood at the far end of the dais and could see this purple cucuirass coming out of that throne, and in that throne were the faces of all the people who had come to say their vows. And I could see, on the far end of that throne, that this purple mantle had these gems.
Surprise, surprise.
And the jewels glittered. Platinum. Diamonds. Amethyst. Topaz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. No. No. Let me ask you something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You said surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been to a wedding in Manhattan and seen the same purple casserole that you saw the night of the wedding garnished with fifteen garnets? Have you ever been to a wedding in Manhattan and seen that purple velvet couch, and the purple velvet box that holds it, and the purple paper lantern suspended from the ceiling? Have you ever been to a wedding in Manhattan and seen that? And what do you think is on the far end of that throne? Platinum? Diamonds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 69 Imaginary Friend</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-069"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a story I keep telling myself. I have this imaginary friend who I would like to travel with and date. What would we do?&lt;br /&gt;
What would we do if we were completely honest with each other?&lt;br /&gt;
What would we say if we didn’t hold onto our fantasies and prune our memories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is always the same. Well, maybe not exactly what I have in mind, but there’s this friend I want to travel with, and one thing leads to another, until eventually I have you and I no longer have any boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that it doesn’t matter if we ever get together because I guarantee that one day, if we’re still together, you will kiss me. And I will kiss you because I will be the one who knows that I was wrong to harbor such a fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;
What if I told you that even though I may have fallen in love with you, that I did so after much soul searching and agonized bargaining, that I took the plunge anyway, knowing full well that I was wrong to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, what would you do?&lt;br /&gt;
What do you do when your lover is dead but you still want to have an affair? You cheat on your lover with a stranger. Or, worse yet, you lie and say that you have no lovers.&lt;br /&gt;
Or maybe you have just had one.&lt;br /&gt;
Or, if you’re lucky, you’ve just had two.&lt;br /&gt;
And what do you do when all your lovers have left? You take their photographs and cut them up and burn them.&lt;br /&gt;
Or maybe you cut off their fingers and eat them.&lt;br /&gt;
Or maybe you just farted in their faces.&lt;br /&gt;
All of these horrible acts are committed by people we know to be our lovers. People we love and care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we ever get it together in a real relationship if they know everything?&lt;br /&gt;
There’s always the chance that they could be lying to us.&lt;br /&gt;
There is always the chance that they do know.&lt;br /&gt;
One time or another, we lie to ourselves, to each other, to the world. And it’s up to us to repel these temptations. To know that love is not a game, that it is, in fact, something more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for sexuality to be lived as oriented? What difference does it make what or who we are oriented toward in the very direction of our desire? If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence, of how we inhabit spaces, and who or what we inhabit spaces with. After all, queer geographers have shown us how spaces are sexualized. If we foreground the concept of “orientation,” then we can retheorize this sexualization of space as well as the spatiality of sexual desire. What would it mean for queer studies if we were to pose the question of the orientation of sexual orientation as a phenomenological question?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 68 Areas of Concentration</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areas of Concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Practice makes perfect. Here I am, practice makes perfect. All at once. Perfection in motion. My entire life has gone by in that matter of a few seconds. But that’s another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Concentration. My practice today is going to be all about becoming more and more concentrated. As I breathe out, I want you to think of me in blue sheets and want me in white chairs. I want you to imagine me perfectly draped in white sheets and then to imagine that idealized image on the white surface of a coffee table. Just imagine it. Maybe it’s me in a blue sheet under a blue star. Maybe it’s me on a white beach in the middle of a party. Maybe it’s even me in a party in which I have drunk hundreds of cups of coffee. But whatever you imagine, think of me perfectly draped in white and my hands all over you. And as I relax into this image, imagine the coffee in my hand and the blue of my sheet caressing my naked body. It’s going to feel so good. I want you to imagine me perfectly relaxed, my whole body quivering with the desire to show you just how perfectly I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I let myself drift further into sensual slumber as your fingers trace along my hip? Will my thighs quiver as you run your fingertips along my lined button-holes? Will my breasts jiggle as you fondle them? Will my skin crackle with a primal call to arms that has nothing to do with fatigue or lack of nourishment? Will my hair stand on end as you stroke my head and caress the back of my neck? Will my eyelids flutter shut as you fondle the sides of my face? Will my chest rise as you press against my sternum, and will my hair fall in waves as it drips onto the cold sheet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are finished, I want you to put your hand on my hip and pull me toward you. You will see more than I have in the last three months. You will feel more than I have in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think you have a monopoly on desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonsense. My students have been known to squander energy chasing after imaginary white sheets. Imagination is just a good guess, practice makes perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d like it if it were a handkerchief.&lt;br /&gt;
It has to be something soft, something that slides up my wrist so I can touch it without making myself wet. &lt;br /&gt;
I love when you put your hand on my hip and I can feel the warmth, the dampness, of your skin against my back.&lt;br /&gt;
I just want to kiss you.&lt;br /&gt;
I want you to move your hand away from my hip and cup my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 66 The Father of Queer Theory</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-066"/>
   <updated>2022-05-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-066</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I want to tell you that every queer person who has ever been and ever can be. There’s a crowd waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to come out of the closet, I’d wait until the day it was officially over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer theory is as old as queer politics, but it has only recently begun to make inroads into the popular imagination. Raymond Williams made a splash with Capital in the early fifties with his concepts of the fetishization of sex and the political economy of sexuality. By the time Capital was published, several prominent radical feminists had come out as lesbians or as queer themselves. As a result, Capital became the first book to make clear that a political analysis of sex and sexuality could be intelligently combined with an analysis of gender. While Capital did not offer a complete theoretical account of the subject, it did offer a starting point for developing a more sophisticated and theoretically informed analysis of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of Murray Bookchin, whose theory of alienation and the need for political revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just trying to help you understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the point. The point is that Bookchin was the father of queer theory. And even before he wrote Capital, there were strong currents within the sex movement that were trying to reexamine their own assumptions about the nature of sex, and the social organization of sex. For queer theory to really take off, those of us in the movement had to come together to develop a much more sophisticated theory of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you saying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want queer studies to take off, we have to&lt;br /&gt;
Right. But we&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t think there’s any way of doing that,&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not trying to&lt;br /&gt;
I mean, it’s impossible. Queer theory has never taken off. And to think that it’s going to take off in the next few years is just&lt;br /&gt;
We have the big theoretical challenge of&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t want to oversell this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;
My lover will lead the way&lt;br /&gt;
Out of the car, she will follow&lt;br /&gt;
And I will follow&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere between kissing and blowing kisses, hands on hips&lt;br /&gt;
Orgasm. Maybe a shout&lt;br /&gt;
Something sexier&lt;br /&gt;
And I will be&lt;br /&gt;
Queer.&lt;br /&gt;
In love. Satisfied. Complete.&lt;br /&gt;
Imperious. Sexy. Prickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had sex with anyone who wasn’t straight? Or with someone just because of their sexual preference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had sex with anyone just because they had AIDS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had sex with someone just because they smelled different from you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had sex with anyone who wasn’t straight? Or with someone just because of their sexual preference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had sex with someone just because they had a medical problem? Been hospitalized? Been on chemotherapy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always fooled around with people just because they looked different from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’d imagine.&lt;br /&gt;
And I will be&lt;br /&gt;
Seducing. Guilt. Betrayal. Abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be loved, cherished, and accepted for who I really am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am addicted to sex. I masturbate before sex and after. I don’t get horny until after the sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re being ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it really doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I know is that I want more than that. And I will be there to give it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always had a wicked sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 63 Homosexual In-laws</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-063"/>
   <updated>2022-05-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-063</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Jealous?
Oh shit! It is possible.
Who do you love? Do you have friends that you go out with all the time? That’s okay.
That’s not my fantasy. I never had a real fantasy about going out with anyone.
Maybe you do. Or maybe you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a typical gay boy. I am not a typical gay man.
Not according to popular fashions. Or popular wisdom.
Not according to what the research says.
Or popular courtship tactics.
I am not a typical gay man.
Or popular ways to fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are. Or maybe you aren’t. But whatever you are, don’t call me Christopher Reeve or John Wayne. I am NOT like that! I am NOT! I am NOT a gay boy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. So, what are you?
I am NOT an effeminate effeminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what you are!
You could be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, wouldn’t be the first to say so! Don’t you think there should be some kind of…
Sodomy laws.
Oh! Sodomy laws! Like the one in New York.
The one in New York! And what about those in California, Washington, DC, Massachusetts, Wyoming, and even Canada?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you talking about? Oh! You mean like inani-fuckers! Homosexual in-laws!
I didn’t use the expression “sodomy laws.” I use the expression, “homosexual in-laws.”
“In-laws.” Homosexual in-laws. Oh! You have one. Two. Three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may have had one, but I don’t anymore. In fact, I don’t think I have ever had a lover. Most of my closest relationships have been platonic, long-term affairs. They never climaxed and usually wound up hurting the person in some way. Not me. I like love. I have a great, abiding, if occasionally paranoid fondness for cats and grasshoppers. I married a nice woman once, although her tastes in men were… questionable. I have never had a lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had sex with someone you loved?
I don’t think I’ve ever had sex with anyone.
With anyone?
Well, no. And I’m sure you never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never would have dreamed of proposing to you if I had known you were gay.
Why not?
Well, there’s the matter of custody.
What’s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matter of custody. I mean, if I do live with you, do you want me to report you to the authorities as though you were the one who was being homosexual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would amount to child molestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s an interesting point. Because the law doesn’t care if you’re gay or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law does care. In California, if you’re found with “gay pornography” you can be imprisoned for up to two years and fined up to a maximum of $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On second thought, I don’t think that’s a fair punishment. I mean, even if you’re found to be having homosexual fantasies, it’s still wrong to punish a child for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge didn’t seem to take into account that even if the fantasies were about sex acts with other boys, that’s still wrong. So, I suppose it’s up to the parents to decide what’s wrong with their child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge also seemed to think that since it was a consensual relationship, it didn’t matter if it was being done by a boy or a girl. And that even if the two of you had had homosexual fantasies, that didn’t change the fact that you were a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I suppose it’s up to the judge to make a call on whether your son should be punished for what he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, I think you should try to understand my position better.
You are my mother. Period. And I will protect you.
You are putting my life in danger. I will not testify against my son, and I will fight to the death to keep my son in this school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to equate this to consensual homosexual acts with what it is in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to turn this school around, Mr. Reiss? I will fight to the death to keep it that way.
This isn’t the First Amendment we’re talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is what it is. A public school. A place where boys can learn. A place where I, a woman, could be a lesbian. That’s what the law is.
Shit! Now that’s got me.
You may call the school tomorrow and we can all meet with the principal and hopefully get something worked out.
But, my mother and I will not testify against our son. And we will fight to the death to keep our son in this school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle’s just begun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine meeting other queer people for the first time, going to a gay bar on Friday night, cruising the gayborhood all night, then cruising the following Saturday night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How romantic!&lt;br /&gt;
What would we eat? What would we do?&lt;br /&gt;
How many alcoholic drinks will we consume?&lt;br /&gt;
Will there be blow jobs?&lt;br /&gt;
Can we make love in public places?&lt;br /&gt;
Is there the possibility of bodily harm?&lt;br /&gt;
If we do it in public, will there be angry mob action?&lt;br /&gt;
Queer sex workers.&lt;br /&gt;
Are there bisexual sex workers?&lt;br /&gt;
What about intersex sex workers?&lt;br /&gt;
Are there people with multiple sex partners?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love to imagine the wild and crazy, the wild and crazy nights! But there has to be a balance. We can’t just take the wild and crazy and run with it. There has to be a careful balance.
There has to be an emotional center. Romance has to be based in truth. There has to be. Trust, respect, and affection have to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about this… Let’s say we’re a couple and we go out to a bar on a Friday night. Friday is gayborhood time. There’s a big line at the front. People are queuing up behind the counter and waiting to get into the gayborhood. Suddenly there’s this gorgeous young man, just comes out of the bathroom naked, and he’s just staring straight into our eyes. And he’s got these big round eyes and he’s got this Wow! What an amazing body!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what they say, if it has wings, it’s a bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His eyes are blue, like two balloons stuck together. His hands are covered in glitter. His feet are covered in glitter. His arms are covered in glitter. His mouth is covered in glitter. His tongue is glitter. His hair is silver. His hair is wild and curly and beautiful and it’s blowing in all directions. All night long people are staring and people are taking photos and people are taking videos. Say what you want about this young American gentleman. He just came out of the bathroom naked and he’s staring straight into our beautiful eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could disappear.
You mean disappear?
I could disappear right in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a painting by Paul Cadmus at the top of this page.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you very much. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;
What was it about?&lt;br /&gt;
The Crucifixion. I think.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. That’s it. The Crucifixion. The bloody Crucifixion.&lt;br /&gt;
What does it mean to be young again?&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Yes. It’s important.&lt;br /&gt;
What is it like to have the most vile human being in the world as your lover?&lt;br /&gt;
I want to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;
How many times can you do that? How many orgasms can you hold in one go?&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus Christ. One more.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you know what you want?&lt;br /&gt;
I want a cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;
You want to be fucked.&lt;br /&gt;
Done.&lt;br /&gt;
How often do you want it?&lt;br /&gt;
Once a week?&lt;br /&gt;
Once a month?&lt;br /&gt;
Once a week or every two weeks?&lt;br /&gt;
How often do you want it in your mouth?&lt;br /&gt;
How many orgasms can you make in one second?&lt;br /&gt;
How many strokes can one hand hold?&lt;br /&gt;
One minute, two minutes, five minutes…&lt;br /&gt;
Is it painful?&lt;br /&gt;
Does it make you horny?&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes I’m stone hard and sometimes I’m oozing wet passion.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you like it?&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not sure yet.&lt;br /&gt;
Tell me about it.&lt;br /&gt;
You like it when I give myself a break.&lt;br /&gt;
And you have to make do.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve given myself a break. I don’t think I can last more than a few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
Very good.&lt;br /&gt;
The pain is… so… oh God… is so… oh God… do I look like shit?&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
Fuck it.&lt;br /&gt;
We are protected by a piss-can factory.&lt;br /&gt;

Hug me.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Yes.&lt;br /&gt;
Come here and put your hand in.&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 60 Gay Tony Soprano</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. A fantasy in which queers never existed. What if queers never existed? In which the experience of queer sex was as exotic, reducible, and downright criminal as any other kind of sex work. In which johns and girls in leather suits took turns fucking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queers are no longer a crime. We have the right to exist. We can protest, we can lobby, we can walk the streets, we can adopt a child, we can wed, we can fuck in public, we can love in private, we can bleed out on the streets. But we mustn’t become martyrs, like Che Guevara. We mustn’t become Haskins. We mustn’t become deserters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one more minute. I want you to fingerbang him. I want you to rough me up. I want you to pleasure yourself while I scream. Ah, fuck it! Let’s stop fetishizing violence. Hit him, slap him, pull his hair, bite his face, gouge out his eyesocket, nose, ears, genitals, whatever it is he wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now see this. If we screw up big time, there won’t be a funeral. We’ll be left alone. No one will talk about it. And no one will care. They’ll think we lost a son, that he was a lost cause. No one will say, he was a failure. He may as well have been a Gay Tony Soprano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that now I’m being watched. And it’s not just him. There’s the television. Too bright. And in the closet. This is very embarrassing. I’m not used to being watched in the bedroom. But there are mirrors and dresser drawers. And bookshelves. And leather. And silver screens. And little caddies in tiny little outfits. So what if it’s a little noisy. And there’s a slight breeze blowing outside. And dust. And flies. And the bedroom door is open and the lights are on. I could die. Or they could hear me. They’ve all moved upstairs. I don’t know why they’re here. I do. I can hear everything. And everything’s black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I know who you are. I know that you are a homosexual. And you know that I know what it feels like to be watched and to have my dignity insulted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can always tell what it feels like to be watched. I know what it feels like to be touched. I know what it feels like to be touched in a way that makes your heart leap. I know what it feels like to have someone put their arm around your waist and pull it close. I know what it feels like to have someone put a pillow around your neck and try to kiss you. I can even imagine what it feels like to be slapped and to be nuzzled against a wall. Maybe it feels so real. Or maybe it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

What are you hiding from me?&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t you remember?&lt;br /&gt;
Touch me, baby. Tell me everything.&lt;br /&gt; Do I look sexy in purple? Orange? Auburn?&lt;br /&gt; Bold. Curly. Tit. Round. Round. Round. Soft. Hard. Tit! Ass.&lt;br /&gt; Round ass, ass up, ass down.&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 55 Queer Prophet</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always been my dream to have my very own private lesbian bar. The only problem is, there aren’t any bars in this town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, there are bars! Such as in Atlanta and San Francisco, where Queer Rebels meets every third Thursday. And in New York City, we are soon to have our very own dedicated lesbian karaoke night club, Les Belle Journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles there’s the now-defunct ymag, and soon-to-be-defunct Dyke March. Meanwhile in San Francisco, the long-vacant Golden Gate Park is home to The Village Lesbian Comedy Theater, a weekly, all-ages stand-up club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for my very own dedicated queer cabaret club. My very own dedicated queer karaoke night club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the hell are these other queer bars? You all think they’re great. I could never get into any of these bars in my wild youth. Where are the other queer cabarets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I waited in a cab for my turn, passing gay bars and clubs that were as gay as the day they were created, I could hear the conversation going on in my cab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooh, newscaster impressions! Queer Prophet is opening its office in a gayborhood!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school my best friend and I made love in a school bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend and I were both in the same honors college and had just begun getting serious about getting married. Prior to that, we had only it done once, in a dorm room, and it was amazing. We got wild and had a lot of sex, and we were beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I didn’t realize just how much I missed having complete control over my own sex life. We never even told each other’s names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now I don’t know how we held our sexual freedom. We loved each other, but not the way most people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in love with a very attractive young man. Prior had a lot of money. Prior and I were very good friends. Prior was a very rich man. Prior had a whole fleet of expensive cars. Prior was a very powerful man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cars, the parties, the sexual conquests. It was all so exciting, and yet I was terrified. I felt as though I was running scared at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that romantic high flying, and there I was i lying next to him on the bed, doing bear hug, when all of a sudden he says, Don’t worry about it, I’m not into that kinda stuff. Don’t rush an artist. I can’t believe he actually said that. My jaw dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around for anyone else to comfort me but none of them would listen. I began to cry. Finally, someone from my dorm said, You know those guys at work used to give you a hard time just for being queer? Well, they’re going to give you another hard time this year if you don’t get out of line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn’t take long to figure out that this was no ordinary college buddy comedy. A bunch of our theater friends were having a bar-b-que, pretending to be gay. Actually, it was more of a bathhouse comedy pitting two gay high school students against one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. A friend of Harvey’s has this cabin on a steep hill overlooking the Willamette River. The fire is still burning and the smell is unbearable. He tells me he has a “dream” this weekend in which he thinks he is in “The Pit.” I ask him what it is he imagines himself doing there. He tells me he envisions himself leading a normal, middle-class existence. Then, he tells me, suddenly he senses something terrifying and insists I get out of bed. He says he has been taking hallucinogenic drugs lately, such as Valium and Valium + Lysergic acid diethylamide. He says he dreams of swimming through rapids, of tigers and lions, of armies marching on fields. Lunatic fringe orchard. A quiet place for the weekend. June.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 51 Kentucky</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-051"/>
   <updated>2021-09-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-051</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Kentucky. My father was a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s a pretty good background to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not much, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I like the Kentucky scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s true. It makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I’m driving down the highway, I like to imagine what it would be like if you could see me. There’s a sort of suburban fantasy in Kentucky. It’s not too far from town. It’s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not into that type of thing. I don’t like suburban scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like scenery. That’s what I like to see. I’m in a hurry. I have to be in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re about to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be my guest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new convertible. It’s got heated front seats, power windows, leather upholstery, power sunroof, moonroof… and a 5.2-speakers, big-screen surround sound, and a six-point sun map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And heated sunroof and moonroof and 4-wheel drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to have an affair with this beautiful lady. My fantasies are not limited to your country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just going to say… I like the look of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Tamed. Comfortable. Smart. Not demanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not demanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just going to say… I could care less if you’re black, gay, brown, or whatever your assigned sex at school is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be firm. I’m not here to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a sexologist. My name is Dr. Ben Carson. I have done thousands of studies on human sexuality. And I can tell you from personal experience that the vast majority of men and women who find satisfaction in sex, desire it the same way you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they do. Maybe they don’t. But whatever the reason, most men and most women are far from satisfied with their sex lives. They want more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want more than that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “want more than that.” This attitude is repellent to millions of men and women who want to be loved, safe, and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never asked you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would you have done if I had asked you? You would have told me to fuck off. I wouldn’t have, wouldn’t I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you want me to fuck you anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s the kind of guy you are. You are repulsive to me. You are repulsive to me because…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not repulsive to you. You are repulsive to me because you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t get past that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see? It’s like that. It goes with the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll notice, I’m not finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may ask a question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you ever…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in a garden party and I went down and met an old man who was dying of cancer. He was very kind to me and he was asking me how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: “Goodbye, darling, you are much prettier now than you were at the party.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know what a garden party was. I thought it was just a party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would he come down and meet you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, he said: “I must tell you that I am very sad, and that is the best way I can express my feelings. I am on my death bed. I don’t know if I can live anymore. And, for my part, I must tell you that I am sorry.” I said: “Yes, I understand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did he say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very sorry. It seems that I have lost my voice. I am so sorry. I hope I never lose it again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Goodbye, darling. It is my last time with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s terrible, isn’t it?&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God. What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sea.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea is the mother of all disasters.&lt;br /&gt;
The sea is God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. It’s just a metaphor.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s like living on the moon.&lt;br /&gt;
Lumen, illuminate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to talk about the sea now.&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t imagine what it must be like on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s why I’m here. It’s so clear. I love it here.&lt;br /&gt; There’s no one else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not even sure I believe what I’m saying.&lt;br /&gt;
I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
You have to let them know that you love them.&lt;br /&gt;
I love them. I do. I do. I do.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s really wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s just so overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s impossible.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s okay.&lt;br /&gt;
I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God. I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not sure I believe what I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s really too clear.&lt;br /&gt;
I think I love you, too.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s the moon.&lt;br /&gt;
I think I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
We have to find a way to express love.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
I feel… nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 48 The Perfect Plot</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-048"/>
   <updated>2021-09-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-048</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody in the theater says it has the perfect plot. But I can tell you from my own experience that there are many, MANY more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaningless platitudes and preachers on TV bring no joy to anyone, let alone the people you love. We need to find something real in the ordinary, the commonplace, the commonplace that’s exceptional. We have to let go of what we don’t understand, or don’t want to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idyllic music, breath taking lighting, and fountains of colored lights will bring everyone to a stand still and soak up the ambiance. Then everyone will dance and shout and hug and pray and cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be quiet. I’m sure I’m interrupting just before my very eyes the moment a perfectly ordinary high school senior kisses a beautiful redhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Heaven were a movie, Id love to see how they handled the love triangle. Would they twist the knife and sacrifice Tom Cruise so they wouldn’t have to cast their hearts into that proverbial garden?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory goes something like this. On one end we have the good Christian boy whose heart is always in the right place. On the other we have the Beast, filthy little queer wanted by every grade school principal with a hankie for big hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icks! Shell shock! It’s all too much to hope for in the face of temptation. So what do we do? Build a wall, knock the shit out of each other, raise hell, take out shotguns, gut cows, and start killing the shit inside each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I guess I just have to get used to the feeling that most of what I believe in is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit? I have no need for it! Keep out of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you trying to convert me, Tom? Do you ever think maybe I could be…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idolatry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, you lost me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve, my dear, in large part on your ability to let go of the things you don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a wonderful feature of the English language… they can say just about anything and it’s perfectly acceptable. I’m still not used to the idea that I owe my life to anybody but myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greek tragedy, tragedy, fuckin’ tragedy. Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 47 Orphobia</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve narrowed it down to three broad broad groups:
Biphobia. Lesbianism. Androgyny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I go through these please think of the people you didn’t even know were queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biphobia. Biphobia is when a person’s attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on stereotypes, stereotypes that are not based on reality. For example, some people think that if they are gay they cant get laid because they’re too feminine. This is called the Biphobia effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orphobia. Orphobia is when a person’s attraction to one sex or the opposite sex is based on the idea of the sacred or sacred gender. For example, some people think that if they are priests they cant get laid because they’re too masculine. This is called the Orphobia effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orphobia and Androphobia. Orphobia and Androphobia are usually in conflict. For example, some people may have very strong or very weak attraction to both men and women. Orphobia can also lead to the idea that a person may or may not be gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover and I have been lovers for many years. He is a doctor. I admire his precision. I want to work with him on a large project. His specialty is bone marrow. We have many years together, many children. We have a home, a life together. But something happens that changes everything. He leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not suddenly; rather slowly over many months, years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Wait, I want to go back to the house where we first met. I want to go back to the moment that made me want to lose myself. I want to go back to that week in March, when the phone rang, the appointment set, and the motherly words, “Baby, it’s Tuesday!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the moment the beautiful woman on the phone asked me if I was gay. My heart skipped a beat at the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the moment the beautiful woman on the phone put her arm around me and said, “Can I get you anything, sweetheart?” My heart skipped a beat again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the moment the motherly words, “I love you,” filled my heart and sent me dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get to be president of the United States…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to put an X on that card and shove it up your nose. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get elected…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to have one of your senators tattoo my bicep with the words: “I Love Barrett’s Ass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get elected, I am going to eliminate the F.B.I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first act will be to sign a bill making it a crime to aid any foreign power in resisting American domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to end sex education in our public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first act will be to eliminate the F.B.I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the Human Rights Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second act will be to eliminate the American Humanist Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. We have one less voting bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sumba! We have won!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 44 Born This Way</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-044"/>
   <updated>2021-03-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-044</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I Was Born This Way. Noted workhorse of the gay liberation movement, author of Every Little Girl a River, and the mother of Stonewall Jane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. The life of Stonewall Jane. The story of how a bunch of dykes from the Lower East Side of Manhattan came together to create a gay women’s organization whose mission statement read: “A pure, unadulterated, non-committed, non-homoerotic, non-monogamy organization dedicated to the improvement of the human sex and to the organization of sex education in schools.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty Cochrane. The name stuck. We knew it. We incorporated in the same year that Laurel and I came out. We started doing face-to-face meetings to sort of hammer out our differences. And we loved each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, I was a little afraid that if I came out, that my relationships with men would be put under a bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of research that suggests that being gay does in fact make you more homophobic, and that a great many gay men are still homophobic. And that some of those men are probably still in abusive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be real, Laurel, and we were not going to play by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would have been ostracized from my friends. Laurel, Cathy, I have a confession to make. I was wrong about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of the hostility I’ve seen toward people who are gay comes from two places. One is from people who want us as we are. The other is from people who think that because we do things that are different from their way of life that somehow we’re somehow lesser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s such a frightening thing to think about, Kitty, because we could all be dead. So, Kitty, I’ll ask you this another way. How many gay men are in abusive relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re being silly. Do you have any idea how many men I’ve known who would sleep with me and be faithful to me no matter what? I have slept with hundreds. I have slept with thousands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just how many straight men do you know who cheat on their wives? I’m not asking you to give me any statistics, Kitty. But you would know, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping with other men has nothing whatsoever to do with a man being a good father. And the myth that men who cheat on their wives are somehow “disingenuous,” as one friend put it, flies in the face of all the hard science on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you’re upset that we didn’t get along, but I want you to remember one thing: Laurel and I were best friends. We had our differences, and we hung in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 43 Libertine Saint Theresa</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be a Saint Theresa of the Immaculate Conception! Libertine Saint Theresa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mean you’d rather die than fuck a faggot? Then pick up a book and study the gay life in America. Look at the commercials for birth control, the doctor shopping, and the endless commercials for condoms. And what are we left with? Chopped liver, aching muscles, joint pain, and, God forbid, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cancer is preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A healthy age for men to have sex is between the ages of 18 and 24.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Condoms prevent AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop telling me what I can and can’t do! I want to be free to love and be myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’d still rather have a faggot as your lover than a saint like me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will, baby! You’re so fucked! What’s the matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will, baby! Just take it away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! I nearly died. I thought I’d die the way so many other closeted faggots do. A bullet would have stopped me. But I had Saint Theresa and the bullet didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will. Now stop giving me a faggot’s pittance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want more? I love a real relationship, where you can be yourself and I can be you. No more gay porno!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate all that gay crap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porn is bad for your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive been tested negative for Viagra, and they give you a hard time getting it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never told me about your erectile dysfunction shots!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ve never even told you about my life with a man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a faggot’s pittance, just like I want a faggot’s life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive had enough of this discussion. Get out of my room. You want Saint Theresa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free will, baby! I want to die!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;This is for real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to imagine how I would feel if you were a man and I were a woman. Imagine kissing, holding hands, doing intimate body poses. How would we feel? How could we love? How could we live our lives? What would our fantasies be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to have you follow me home from the store and spend the night like we used to. We’d take turns kneeling in the dark, covering each other with our arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I turned hostile and said, “I don’t want to see you anymore” and you had to fight me? What would our fantasies be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see you walk down the street alone at night, your breasts swaying as you pass men on the street. I’d love to see the look in your eye as you turned and flashed that “I do”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He takes her to his place. She takes the elevator up. He goes through the bedroom door. She becomes aware of LIL J. They kiss. He goes into the bathroom. She becomes aware of JOSHUA. They embrace. They go into the bedroom. She becomes aware of KITTY. She removes her hand from JOSHUA’s neck. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She pulls her pants up. She becomes aware of RITA. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She pulls her pants up. She becomes aware of JOSHUA. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She becomes aware of KITTY. She lies down on the bed. She pants. She becomes aware of RITA. She lies down on the bed. She pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lil and Joshua have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lil J awakens at 4 a.m. to a phone call from KITTY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could have kept you, honey. I miss you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gave your life to make someone else feel better. That is what true love is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad you feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more phone sex please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A phone sex alert?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would ever want a Larry Merchant-sized dick in their mouth after that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May I have the number?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number is a bonus on my next book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May I use it please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I mean, hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. Great. So how’d you do last night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do very well. I don’t usually hang around bars after dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s okay. So, tell me about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a writer. Just not very good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what drew you to the theater?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a shrink once. He was a playwright I knew and trusted. And I figured if I could get laid free of his yokel bullshit, maybe I could write my own book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not your book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No! Look, I just remembered I have to be up front with Kitty about what I do. I’m not the straight woman you think I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then act like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Act like Kitty. You know I won’t lie to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty would be proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not if it meant telling her about me fucking a shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine me doing that to my wife?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t you tell me that you and Kitty hooked up on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because… well, because, that’s how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a great way to start a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No you’re not. But just fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you too much to give you up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care! Fucking would be one thing. Threeways is another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking might change things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not. But fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something I can do?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. Not that I’m exaggerating when I say it’s a gay communal fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, how about this. . . one night, maybe in Miami Beach, Florida, Or in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, buddy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe in Detroit, MI. You get the picture. The ultimate in communal fantasy could be in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I love it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hated by most of my friends, despised by my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I love queers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if it’s not gay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t know anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t know anything about love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not accepting of any kind of love of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you suppose it is that makes me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queers love more than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I don’t know. I guess it’s our nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if that’s the case, why don’t we just call each other by our first names, like we used to do in elementary school? Like we used to do when we first met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t even joke about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all seem to be drawn to strong, masculine Omigod… it’s so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omigod! How could you resist me? Let’s just say you’re attracted to men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s crazy talk, sweetheart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say you fall somewhere in the “Not Straight” or “Not Gay” spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just happen to fall somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you said attraction doesn’t have to be based on sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell was that about? I said it has nothing to do with sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what you said all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never said anything about not being attracted to men. I just said it has nothing to do with sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think I’m “acting gay,” not realizing that your bait-fish is a sex symbol transformed into a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s ridiculous. You said you just assumed I was straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t think I assumed it based on sex, but on your very own words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t think I “asked” you. I “asked” him… to come over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to start acting funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just trying to help you understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you invited me over just so you could brag to me about how you “converted” him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t “convert” him. I “healed” him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You “healed.” Oh, that’s another word for “reformed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re going to tell me how it changed you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t think I could have been happy with Harvey if I hadn’t tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had every intention of turning your life around. All you had to do was follow my suggestions and you’d be straight again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What “suggestions” did I “suggestion” you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, you absolutely insisted that I get tested for STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You CONFUSED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it’s not funny. You just said I “asked” you to come over. That’s ridiculous…. Because whatever you may have thought about our relationship, you never asked me to come over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn’t I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, did you. And that’s just what’s “confused.” You “asked.” You CONFUSED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s new?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve certainly confused me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything between us that you don’t KNOW is homosexual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please! There are lots of areas where we MAY be. I just haven’t been exposed to them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you may be right about that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the life of me, I can’t fathom how you could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t “convert” you just because you asked me over. I wouldn’t “ask” anyone just because they asked me. It just doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could it if you’re just trying to say that I’m gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm… maybe it is… just not me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a moment to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do you go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. I love a man who has nothing to do with me, is not in love with me, is not even in the romantic category. He’s just plain gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He takes no crap from me. He doesn’t call me all the time to see how I am. He’s never made more than a passing remark about my haircut or the color of my eyes. He’s not interested in our child-rearing or our falling in love. He’s simply there for me when I’m at my best and when I need him most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s not interested in our personal romances or our painful but ultimately fulfilling gay sex. He simply is… plain… gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a unicorn.&lt;br /&gt;

Or a unicorn mare.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it a gay love story. A love story between men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could die.&lt;br /&gt;
I could fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;
I could be disowned by my family.&lt;br /&gt;
I could go to jail.&lt;br /&gt;
I could be in love with a woman.&lt;br /&gt;
I could leave my wife and kids for a man.&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 36 Safe Sex</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-036"/>
   <updated>2020-12-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-036</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lover is bisexual and we love each other. He has two wives. One of them he calls mistress and the other he calls girlfriend. They sleep together in their house and he picks up the checkbook at the Post Office. Then he goes to work and leaves the money for the mistress. When he arrives home, he sorts the checkbooks and returns the money to the wives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like what you’re saying. I think of that wonderful American tradition of giving and giving and giving. We give without expecting anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve never been intimate with anyone before, have you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then what do you know about safe sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that intercourse without condoms can cause serious and sometimes fatal diseases. I’ve heard that going too fast can lead to infection. And that condoms don’t provide immediate protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you say you’re straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am! And I’ve been tested for STIs and haven’t had an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you take precautions? What about personal hygiene?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty good at that. I wash my hands after sex and after sex often enough to make sure none stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you take precautions after sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sex I use a condom, but usually only under very duress and for a very brief time. I don’t take precautions at other times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a condom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why don’t you just fuck me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to fuck you, but I’m too scared to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a fuck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I do. I might be bisexual and that makes me less safe. But I might be scared of what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re too scared to be safe. You could infect everyone you love. It’s not too late to change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am changing my mind. I’m going to have my first ever sexual experience tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please stop fucking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay! Fine! Great! Now let’s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christ, you’re such a tease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 35 American Christian</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-035"/>
   <updated>2020-12-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-035</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a recount of one night in a gay cruising bar. This is not a recount of one drunken night in a gay bar. This is my story. My story. So I began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of ‘89 I was in the process of becoming a fully fledged American Christian. No, really. You read that right. At the time I was working at the small boutique gift shop selling Christian girls tchotchkes and earrings. One Sunday morning I went to the Women’s March on Washington. I had just come in from a retreat in Wyoming where we had conducted a sit-in protest march to commemorate the civil rights movement. I was in the process of becoming a full fledged Christian when I noticed a young black woman sitting behind a barricade reading the words from the first chapter of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes in there saying, I am, only I’m trying.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What came over me like a ton of bricks was that woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Away we go, let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that moment on I vowed to myself never to be ashamed of my sexual identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would live every day like the story of Lazarus, refusing to be sickened by the sight of a John, or the smell of a John, or the sound of a John.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would walk the streets of Washington D.C. with a sign that read, Fuck the Law and Fuck the Church. I would attend Bible Studies and believe that I knew God when I saw him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would spend days in coffee shops and on street corners with men who shared my same passions for reading the Bible and watching porn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would kiss boys and girls and think it was all wonderful. I would fall in love with beautiful boys and girls just like Matthew and Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in love!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of that was fake. The real Jesus was nowhere to be found. Fake. Jesus didn’t exist. All of that was wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fool. You fell in love with a boy in a coffee shop who knew no one and just wanted to get laid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fell in love with a beautiful blue-eyed boy who fell in love with you on the first date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fell in love with a gay barkeep who told you that you could be anything you wanted to be if you just bent over and kissed the right amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fell in love with a temple garment and a set of Five Principles and a twelve-step program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You even fell in love with your mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why’s everything all so so quiet now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of God is not a fairy tale. And that was enough to drive me crazy. So I packed my suitcases and left. I vowed never to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

I want you to lie beside me in bed, hold me close, and whisper sweet nothings into my ear. Kiss me gently on the forehead, lick me on the cheek, nuzzle my hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go on. I want you to undo my fly buttons. Pull my blouse down. Pull my underwear all the way down. Pull my sex toy between our legs. Dry me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to finger fuck me. Fiddle with my clit. Bite my nipples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to feel you push me onto the bed. I want to feel you stick your dick into me. I want to rock on my back, to squirm in my jeans as you fuck me. I want you to turn me over on my stomach and grind against me. I want to feel you rim my pussy with your cock. I want you to slip your dick inside me. I want you to pound me until I am screaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want all of this for you. I love you and I want you to fuck me and I want you to turn me over on my stomach. I want you to stick your dick into me, to rim my pussy with your cock, to pound me until I am screaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you so scared of? That one queer might hear you, see you, touch you. That one might walk by and make eye contact. What if they got a peek? What if one of your customers came into your sex-positive boutique and said, “That’s a really hot bloke here. He talks dirty.” Or, “I bet he fucks teenage girls on the street corners.” Or, “He says he likes big cocks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want all of this for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to tell them all about how fag is better than straight and how queers are way too horny to be happy. I want you to make them queers proud of themselves. I want you to change the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you’ve got me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted you to change the conversation. That’s why I came up here today. To change the conversation. And I’ve got my ace up my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corpus&quot;&gt;Corpus&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/queerai&quot;&gt;Queer AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 33 Credible Person</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex and romance without the fear of being judged a pervert or a pervert’s wet dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fantasy so awesome, you wouldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken you to places nobody has gone before. You walked arm in arm with your childhood sweetheart, your best friend’s mother, poured over her shoulder to the jazz club, across the street to the farmers market, hidden in that one gay bar where you met those first few friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you turned, searching, asking the same questions over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer boys and girls together in gay bars doing the same things that you and I do every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer boys and girls in queer leather and punk rock performing in front of thousands of screaming heterosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, in our fantasy, there are no rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No rules?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules that say you can’t kiss because that might spoil the fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that you can’t flirt because that might lead to jealousy or other forbidden behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that you can’t go to the gay bar because it might attract weirdos or the cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that you can’t go to the gay ave because it might invite attacks on the body or the minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we call these safe sex no-no’s are really just excuses for picking on and attacking the weak. Because it’s you against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, we’re not the only ones who have been brainwashed by bigots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gay community has been brainwashed by bigots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve succeeded in brainwashing us into giving up our most cherished civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And turning our back on the millions of wonderful people who come out of the homosexual closet each and every year. They’ve succeeded in brainwashing by demonizing, demonizing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good Lord knows, we could use a little Tear-it-up, tear-it-down, Momma-Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right on. Let’s check our privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty! Equality! Fraternity! Brotherhood! Patriotism!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you see, I grew up hearing that being gay was okay. That being gay was not such a big deal. That you could be…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A GOOD PERSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Credible Person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that if we chose to be like that, we would be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was happy for a time. I was happy for a time. And I still am. Because today those days are over. I don’t go to sleep anymore knowing that, boogeyman, that some radical group of kids was going to demonstrate and gun down those kids just because they were gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not our reality. My brother, Joe, is dead. And those kids just got killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, you said something really nice about my cousin last night. He’s really a swell guy. Don’t get cute. Respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Shepard is a walking Super-Duper Tom Tucker. He’s a product of the left-wing Super-Duper Tom Tucker Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t flatter yourself into thinking you’re any more than slightly tainted by those toxic waters. There are plenty more like you. You probably think you’re just like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I don’t look like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think being gay is like being Mexican, black, brown, or whatever?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of good, decent, human beings who don’t fit into those boxes. There are plenty of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of gay white kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit. Let’s not get political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is politics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the political system, Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine living in a world where people like me didn’t exist? Imagine living in a world where people like that didn’t get the love, support, and safety that I did? There are plenty of those folks out there, Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of my childhood with those people. I didn’t have to grow up with that garbage either. There are plenty of us just like you.
Those poor kids went through hell. They never got the love, support, or safety that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. I was one of them. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of “us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. And I’ll always be one of those “us.” But there are plenty of “us.” And plenty of “us” not like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. I told you. It really is that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think this little insight really hammers home just how simple it is to be me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. . .&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My lover will disappear. I have a lifetime of secrets to keep and he will never see me. I have all the proof. And what am I going to do? Abandon him? Flee to a safe place away from prying eyes and a screaming public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. You have to be brave enough to say it. And tell the world. There is a world out there waiting to be heard. Queer people are not safe from the world. They are on the run. And if they run, so do we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you running from the facts? Or the truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never afraid to be unpopular. I was never afraid to flaunt my queerness. I practiced what I preached. I vowed to myself never to reveal a secret. I was never ashamed to wear my queerness proudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what would you think if I told you I was a psychopathic serial killer? Would you wonder where I went wrong, what I could have done to make you less likely to love me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you would. Or maybe not. But that’s a decision you will have to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you going to live your life like it is or are you going to discover that it isn’t true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many nights I craved the closeness of a good, long lesbian night out on the town. I even had my high school prom dress made just for the occasion. I even had my high school prom dress made for two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many nights I dreamed of strapping on my red leather prom dress and heading out into the frigid night air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many nights I craved the feeling of being watched and touched and mopped up by my favorite teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever told you how turned on you can be in front of a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a gay bar. In a gay porno. On TV. I can’t tell you how many nights I dreamed of being gang-raped and sodomized by my fraternity brothers. And how many nights I dreamed of being gang-raped and sodomized by my schoolmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us at that school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of lustful glances, whispered caresses, or groans in gym class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of sexual innuendos, muttered sexual jokes, or groans at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of sexual requests, whispered or whispered in bed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been the object of drunken brawls, fistfights, and fist-fights in the street?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most gallingly of all, how many times have you been the object of a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not for everyone. But for me it’s a beginning, not a middle, not a destination. I want you to be my friend for the next thirty years or so, not just because I want to but because you want to. I want to hang on to that friendship as long as I can ‘cause it’s that friendship that keeps me going. It may not be the friendship that’s making all the difference in the world, but that’s the friendship I have. And that’s what I want. That’s what you have to understand about me. I am monogamous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So? That’s okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay for you. It’s not always so easy, particularly for those of us with less traditionally masculine tastes. But don’t despair. There are still plenty of you. There are always men. And beautiful men. In men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are lots of lonely queer men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are. But they’re isolated and frightened, too. Maybe you are. Or maybe you aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me help you find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to fuck me. It’s a starting place, not an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. Not an end in and of itself. But a starting place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please. I’m not asking if. I’m just being polite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are you asking? I just don’t want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always do. Because I care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. And that’s not always easy to see or understand. Ask your mother. Your friends. They’ll tell you all about it. We care about you because…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to bet who cares more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care about you because I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly. That’s simple. But it gets complicated. Because I can’t keep hiding, you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many ways are there to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could keep fucking anyone in the world. That’s why I love you so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So could I. It’s why I want to be your friend forever. To carry on the legacy of that friendship that which began thirty years ago and which you continue to love to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep into your soul, you know you want me to take you to a secluded place away from the crowd and show you the beauty and ecstasy of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one has to see that, not your parents, not your co-workers. Or your doctor. Or your priest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priest probably doesn’t approve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative. What about deep-rooted? What about love? What about deep-rooted in you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mothers, fathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to fuck me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t. NO! No one can! I can’t, my mother. NO!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me, Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking me is wrong. It… is wrong. I don’t want to, it makes me sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m horny, make me horny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make me sick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Fuck me. A good boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting wet. I’m horny, make me horny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very good, very good. Slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I look sexy in your yellow… The sexual revolution has… I… well, if only there was one thing that fucked me up good and sent me straight to Heaven. A moment of silence for what was…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to fuck me, you better fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one minute, please. Just one minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever stupid reason. Guess what? I want to fuck you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, fuck me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clothes are dirty. My friends called the cops. I’m scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a time and place for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You… dummy, why don’t you kiss me? I’ll do anything. Go ahead, get in a kiss, anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiss me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that right now it’s just so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are you afraid of me or am I just showing you my…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, the milk’s back. I took the cooler with me. This is crazy, I am a month pregnant. I feel. So fucking. So full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer bastard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go on, babes. Touch us, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, look at him. Boobs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re nice, aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies have no idea what it’s like to be a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tush! Tush!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first trimester. The first days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hurt. Nothing. It was a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ow, my baby. It’s okay. I feel terrific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then some more…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ow, my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not swollen, just a little tender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tender enough that I can put a cap on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to join me…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fantasy is to pick up, unpack, take everything inside me and go on a wild goose chase across America. I want to leave my clothes in the hamper, my favorite socks in the sock drawer, and my favorite shampoo bottles under the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will we find?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that the more I explore my own sexuality the more aroused I become. You’ve seen enough of me to know that my sensual side lags behind my sexual one. Theres nothing between my legs but your clothes. This is called deviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t want you to do this to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sexual fantasies are very limited, and it is the ultimate taboo to talk about them. Even if you’ve shared them with someone before, you are usually reluctant to discuss them or even get involved in the act itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have to do all of this for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t you love that I care? Or maybe you don’t mind me showing you my clothes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My God! Were doing it again! This is so naughty! You take this thing in your hands and work it into my pussy. Oh God yes.. do it with both hands… hard… good! Keep going… oh yes.. feel it inside you.. inside my bellybutton… inside my thighs… inside my tight little jeans… good… keep going… feeling it inside me, filling me up… oh God I want it so bad.. I want it so bad inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright… it comes out. It’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im giving you a blow job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to watch me do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t you dare!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s going to put a condom on my penis, just like last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that hot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to turn on the shower, I’m going to take all my clothes off, I’m going to dry myself off in the hot water, I’m going to stand in front of you, I’m going to take your clothes off and I’m going to turn on the shower… Owwww thats so hot! Don’t you want to touch me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to touch me, but don’t you want to finger me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good boy. There we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren’t enough surprises this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost felt like Elise in Bluebeard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought Elise in Bluebeard was more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get right down to it, Elise is the spiritual mother of kinky sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a claw in my stomach, like the taste of my own blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love when you stroke my hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way your hands feel on my hips and the way you nuzzle my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love feeling your mouth on my earlobe and caress my cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you kiss me and nose me on the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you nuzzle my forehead between kisses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way the corner of my mouth brushes the back of your earlobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you kiss me and nuzzle my forehead against mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way my hand traces the line of your shoe on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way the bed feels on my hip and under my armpits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you nuzzle my forehead between kisses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way the head of your penis brushes the back of my earlobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way my hand traces the line of your shoe on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You taste so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You smell so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dream about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m turning on the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 28 Epiphany</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. My personal fable. It goes something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have my eager young protégé pitching himself in front of me on a silver platter. Prior and I have been lovers forever, and none of us will know except that we got there together and fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, lady friend. Your story doesn’t stack up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh I get it I get it! My story’s so compelling it makes non-fiction look like history. It’s my story and nobody else’s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Ma, we all heard that story about how Doris Day somehow tricked Martin Luther King into coming out of the closet. And how that story stuck with Dr. King till his death. All those years of waiting for that one black boy to come outta the closet and into the mainstream. Remember the kid at the candlestick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin’s story stuck with Dr. King till his death. Not everyone was so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woody Allen once said something that stuck with me. Whatever happened to innocence? At least in Hollywood it’s all going for the taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had that epiphany after a particularly tiresome movie or television spot? All your favorite gags and story lines are mashed up in your head and used as a crutch to keep you up watching television all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s how I was brought up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

&lt;p&gt;I imagine we have a certain role-play in store for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You come running for the door, all excited about what I’ve been cooking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all those candles, incense, incense oil, gourds filled with that forbidden intoxicant, you ready to go… when nary a note, not a note, is left on the table!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to share a fantasy like I have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s it like to be the straight lady who fakes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honey, you’re really cooking for five. Takes a village to make a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it go down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Great. Now let’s entertain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Let’s make Tidy Up Crispy!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could eat this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baking soda and water, lots of baking soda. I baked whole… let me show you… hollandaise sauce! Beeswax. And some Worcestershire sauce! And some Old Bay! And Worcestershire cheesecloth! And a little mayonnaise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love mayo, it brightens things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want your advice on this… mayonnaise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not the mayo, this is the real mayo… the real mayo, made with real mayo! And it’s my new fave!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homemade! By me, for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buenos noches!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 26 Middle Class Homo</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-026"/>
   <updated>2020-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-026</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my Beastie Boy middle child. How many Beasties do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many middle children do you know who secretly fuck other middle children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve known four. or five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four middle children… FIVE!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may deny it, but middle children’s queerness is not a fantasy. It is a fact. It is commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive me for being such a prude. I like to think being middle-class makes me immune to all that snobbery, envy, and mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t? Most of us aspire to something better than mediocrity. We want more from life than being poor, working-class, or gay. What middle-class homo doesn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father is a lawyer. He never fooled around and never took the easy route. He never let my mother down. She believed in me and always gave me everything I wanted. She was my rock. I’d sacrifice anything for her. My two kids, it didn’t matter how debilitating their condition was, they had my unconditional love and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being so goddamn sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You old fart, I don’t need your father’s love or the strained confidence of your mother to know that if I wanted a better life than the one I had growing up in that I should fuck harder than he did. No, I wouldn’t change a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you mean. But most people don’t realize how much more commonplace it is to love queers. In Chico, California, where I grew up, it is commonplace for two adults to fuck. In Atlanta, five young men slept together to avoid bus fares. In Collin, Texas, a gay couple was beaten to death last year after their lovers took their own lives. And last Saturday in Detroit, fifty-three young men gathered for a candle vigil to remember a young woman they had just lost to AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being so goddamn sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. This weekend in Detroit, thirty-one high school students gathered to protest what they perceived as rampant bullying of gay students. In Chicago, an ordinance was passed that calls for the immediate expulsion of students who engage in consensual homosexual acts. And this week in Laurel, Colorado, a mother was arrested after her 16-year-old son told a school resource officer that he was “gay” and wanted to bring a friend to prom dressed as a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired. And I’m not the only one feeling this way. According to a new Pepperdine University School of Law poll, nearly two-thirds of Americans—and nearly four-in-ten Republicans think homosexual behavior is immoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I don’t necessarily think the violence is justified. But then what, exactly are we doing to bring people together? Why do people feel the only thing to hate about people who have something different from us is our sexuality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, we’re not coming here to burn the place down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 25 Sodom or Gomorra</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-025"/>
   <updated>2020-11-14T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-025</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it. Over on the bed was a pink satin nightgown. It was made from a beautiful soft pink satin that matched the soft pink nightgown that was about half the size of her hips. The necklace was of sorts, a set of twelve bracelets set into a pendant. It was a strange design that seemed to capture the essence of the feminine gender perfectly. It was a wondrous design, made by a person with a gift for design. She possessed the gift of the most intimate knowledge of men and women, and combined it with the gift of the most penetrating insight into their deepest secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached up to remove the clasp and the moonlight streamed in through the broken glass and illuminated the white nightgown. There was a hand at my hip, but I was too drunk to do anything about it. All I could do was to pull the nightgown down around my waist, so that the moonlight streamed through the crack in the material as I played with the clasp. As I did this, a hand came up to cup my mouth and toying with the gold stars that adorned the crescent moon that was now partially covered by the midnight blue sky. I pulled it away just enough for the moon to partially illuminate the room as it slowly began to fade from the sky. With a quiet “Ah,” the hand went back and I was awash in a sea of stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was completely drenched in the brilliant blue midnight that was now partially covered by the sunset gold that had been added by the night gladiators. The darkness was so thick that stars shined slightly more intensely as they passed in front of me. I looked up into the face of an angel. Smiling at the ceiling, I continued: I swam back to the dock, filled with my desire to fuck another person. Suddenly a hand grabbed my wrist and I felt it slip from my hand. I instinctively grabbed at it but it was too strong. I fell onto the bed and lay there in a daze for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;padding:100% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/661070055?h=b1eefe6bd4&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;pink-satin-nightgown-angelic-photograph&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;I pulled it away just enough for the moon to partially illuminate the room as it slowly began to fade from the sky. With a quiet “Ah,” the hand went back and I was awash in a sea of stars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the phone rang. It was Emily. On the other line was a woman’s voice. It was a warm, feminine voice, almost feminine in tone. She said, I don’t suppose you could get laid in New Orleans, but there is a place in the District that has some nice women. I picked up the phone and spoke into it. I tried to remember the restaurant and the place, but the words ran together in my head so fast that it was like looking at a jumble of information. I said, I need to go to Kitty’s now. I have a cab with a number that starts in D.C. I can call from there and tell her where I am, and that is all. She said she could give me the number and that was all. I remember her saying that the place was dirty, but I could get it over there if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a surge of desire that day I never got before. I wanted to finger myself and touch myself. I walked into Kitty’s and ordered my food. As I was putting my order, Emily came over and took my order and read it to me. I remember thinking how silly it was to do that in front of her because she knew I would be embarrassed. She explained that she knew a lot of the guys at Kitty’s and that it was her way of showing them off to other guys. She talked about how it felt like they were staring at her in the diner, which made me laugh. She then took me into a bedroom and showed me myself. I was amazed at myself. I was 5’3” and I had big hands and round waists. I had big hands and long legs that gave me a jogging gait. My hands looked sexy in the dark because of the makeup they were put over them. I felt so sexy having sex with a woman because I knew it would be me showing off. I could control my breathing because of the masks I wore. At first I was embarrassed by the idea of showing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Emily if she thought men would be interested in me because of my body. She said it was plausible. Then I thought about all the places I had gone to girls had told me they thought I was hot, so I told her it sounded plausible. She said she had to talk to you. Talk to me. I have a hard time letting go of fantasies about sex with women, even though I want to try it. But I have to face facts. When a man leaves me, he leaves his wife and child for a woman. That’s a frightening thought. And even though I know it doesn’t mean things are going to change, I still feel a deep kinship with that poor girl. She may not be around to see it, but I will always have that window of opportunity. That night, I had a fag. I have a secret. I only eat it after sex. I know that’s a turn-on, but it’s all too much trouble to get it down. Just make it a Sodom or Gomorra. Maybe that’ll turn some heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, I loved the way your feet felt on mine as we walked. I wanted to curl up next to you and kiss you like you used to do when we first met. I wanted to feel the warmth of your body on mine as we cuddled and kissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to have sex with anyone I want. I don’t care how old you are. I don’t care if you’re a junkie, a pre-op, or a grown-up. I don’t care if you smell of beer, smoke, or have a crusty middle-aged mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you. Then fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to kiss? Let me kiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Half-assed kiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giggling and grinding against you, unable to control myself, I grab your wrist and pull you against the wall. I slip my hand inside you and cup your bulge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giggling even more, you say, Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking god, you smell so good. You taste so fucking good. Slurp. Moans. Tastes so fucking good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, I need to fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way you taste. You taste so fucking good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get on your mark. Run your hand up my slit and feel how wet it is. Run one finger up and down my slit, imagining what it would feel like to fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck my nipple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel my clit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep going. Feel my clit again, imagine how hard I would ram a cock into your tight little asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel my clit again, imagine how hard I would ram a cock into your tight little asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lick my swollen clit clean with your saliva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck my nipple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m GORGEOUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lick my swollen clit clean with your saliva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times do I have to tell you, how many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to love a good fuck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you one final time. Half-assed, I jack off in my bathroom, just like I told you the night I disappeared. Just like I told you the night we got busted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your cock tastes so good, why don’t I suck it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I have to suck your big cock?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I tell you that I love big cocks? I love cocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That surprise is really pretty big. You must give it to someone. Someone special. Tell me. Give it to me. I want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 23 144 Loving Arms</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-023"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college, I went to a retreat for gay men in Florida. There were eight of us in a room with 144 men and only three women. All of us had had sex before we met and none of us ever had it again. All of us had learned to live with the possibility that one night our secret might be revealed. There is no need to get sultry tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the women broke down during the lull in the action. We were all in a trancelike state and she blurted out, “I’ve had sex with several men this way. I’ve even had orgasms while doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never had sex with anyone besides my husband.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve only had sex with men who were also gay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Therefore I don’t know if I can love you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been attracted to men. I was even attracted to boys! But one evening I realized I had fallen in love with someone completely different. No more heterosexual books or movies for me. I was an explorer. I could be anywhere and I could be anything I wanted to be with anyone I wanted to be with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been so in love you fell in love with the entire world and suddenly regretted it the next day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could fall in love with anyone. I could fall in love with my television, my computer, my friends. I could even fall in love with my mother. But I did what any good lover would do… I went out and FOUND HIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with a man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. I found a man. A true homosexual! A true HE- man! He was a stay-at-home father, a stay-at-home mother, an Amazon shopper, a stay-at-home homemaker, an Army buddy, a stay-at-home grandfather, an Amazon homemaker, and the President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we have it. You can finally pick and choose among the many loving arms that surround you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s say I have all these wonderful and beautiful arms. But how do I know which one is which?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in percentages. A big percentage. How many men are in a room with 144? How many loving arms can a man have? Is it seven? Is it five? Is it even a four? Do you know how many feet are in a mile? Or how many fingers are on a hand? Or how many feet is the radius of the earth? And how many inches is the width of the moon? Or how many feet is the length of the Grand Canyon? And how many miles is the width of the Grand Canyon and the length of Manhattan Island? And how many people is the mass of the sun and moon and the earth? Is it six?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only six inches between a man and a woman. A woman’s size doesn’t matter. A woman’s curves. There are curves. There are no curves. You can’t see a woman’s curves. All you can see is what you put in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so fine. I have forty-seven loving arms. I have 144 bevy of arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 21 Why We Marry</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I was in the process of becoming a nurse. When I finished high school, I had the advanced training to become a doctor. I wanted to do both. I wanted to love patients and be doctors. So I was the ideal match for the Kinsey Reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you sleep with every man? I mean, would you sleep with all the hunky high school guys? Or would you settle for the studious junior high school teacher? Or the reserved professor? Or the outgoing nurse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would depend on how the relationship went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you want to keep me or give me away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that like saying I’m gay or straight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been straight. And I have never been gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since when do you say that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I read your book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My book is called Why We Marry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the book down several times and when I finally picked it up, it was with a big smile on my lips and a big “I See You” in my voice. I don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you were the only gay person I knew who had read my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. And who read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have secrets. Not just about ourselves. We lie all the time. About our lovers, our friends. About the things we’re embarrassed about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guilty again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, there is one place in the McKinney Bookstore where you can buy my entire Kinsey Reports collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening has all the trappings of a slumber party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please. Let’s get back to the motel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 20 Ultimate Fear</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-020"/>
   <updated>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-020</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a very young girl, there was a gay boy in my school. He was a regular pupil in the chemistry department, not the best of students, who made all the right errors and often got punished for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day his name was on the school register and he was suddenly ostracized and had to go home. No one would talk to him; his schoolmates didn’t want to know about it, and his parents didn’t want to accept that his sexuality was a secret. And a year later his parents sued the school for discrimination and won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gay boy, by the way, that’s not on. What’s it like to be the only openly gay person in a small English town?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I have to adjust to the fact that my life doesn’t count as ordinary in a way that non-English-speakers don’t have to adjust to the fact that theirs does. We still don’t have the right to be “mainstream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s say I’m an outcast. That’s a much easier target. My only options are to either hide out in the most secret corners of the gay gayborhood or find a more accepting school. Which brings me to my ultimate fear…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the isolation most often accompanies the coming out. When I was in high school, my best friend, a nurse, came out as gay at the end of the year. Before that, he had been polite but distant and self-centered. He told me he was straight when he was thirteen and that it had nothing to do with the things we loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took him a long time to come around and tell his parents, who were still somewhat against his decision. I think it was a matter of being rejected so many times by so many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, there wasn’t even Blanche DuBois. I don’t know if coming out would have made a real difference to her life. Probably not, anyway. She had a very straight-White mother, and even though she was pretty open about her attraction to boys, she was perfectly content being a housewife and mother to a white kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mama, there are so many stereotypes about queers out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son is very open about his sexuality. He’s not ashamed of it. In fact, he’s very happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexuality, in general, is still a very new thing. There are so many people queer or multiracial out there. And in many parts of the country, it’s illegal to be homosexual. It’s still illegal in thirty states! Or in the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hank and I are very much in the pro-homosexual camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. And as a lesbian myself, I’m always cautious when I shoplift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t you think it’s important for us to be out front and make our case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is. I do think it’s good public policy to be out front and to be as forthright as we can. People need to know that queers exist and that we’re not easy targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could make the same case about Alan McCarthy, who in the late fifties came out as a dyke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t make the same argument about a mensch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could theoretically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 19 Tenet Master</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-019"/>
   <updated>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-019</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young, I had the fantasy of starting a cult. A religion. I would build a great temple of Wicca up high in the sky, worshiped by all the deities of my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many other Disney princesses, I believed that I could create a pure, whole person out of nothing at all. I would imbue my being with the pure, divine spark that was Tantra, Hatha Yoga, Wicca, Confucianism, Taoism, and so forth. I would set my heart on a path of personal and professional growth that would ultimately lead me to a position of great responsibility and ultimately the crowning glory of my being: a Tenet Master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe deep down, among the many millions of deeply held beliefs that make up the American dream, that there is one indisputable truth that I hold dear: love trumps money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went shopping for a no-knead yeast bread, artisanal vanilla ice creme, and coconut shreds and I paid twenty dollars for it. Thirty dollars for an artisanal vanilla ice creme that has traces of burnt orange and tastes of coconut. Fifty for a slice of lemon with a little bit of mint floating in it. A hundred for a six-pack of beer. A super-duper brewery!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know what you’re thinking. Isn’t this what normal, grown-up folks do? Grab a bottle of whisky and go for a fiver. No gym? No diet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite my rationalizations, I was desperate for the forbidden fruit. I wanted something that would give me the shivers, the flash of a first date, the nudge in the right direction, and then, miraculously, disappear. And I found it. And when I touched it, it was as if someone had pulled me right into their arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was sweet and sour and… And smell it. It smelled just like… heaven. Heaven in a can. Heaven on a stick. Make love in a can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was making love to you. It was over moon rockin in the dark with the moon just barely in the sky. Stars were dancing across the brilliant night sky. In a blur I pictured you sitting there, arms outspread, enjoying the view, your legs spread apart apart, completely nude from the lighting. There was just one problem. There was no starlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you hear the one about how stars don’t glow because they’re full of static? Well, that was true then, and it is true now. Most of us just give up on stars when they get too crowded… or are too bright. We settle for the halo effect… or the twinkling of an orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go to a secluded spot where I can let my imagination run wild. Let it happen. Even in New Orleans it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go to a secluded spot on a wooden pier where the waves crash against the side of a cliff, and the water is so cold I could melt in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go to the edge of a lake where the waves crash against the metal deck, and the wind is so strong that the sail of a ship can be seen twirling in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to take my clothes off in the moonlight and float naked across the cold waters of the Dead Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I could love like none other. I was the fairy godmother to every little boy. They called me “Flute-Tossing Hot-Puss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every summer, I would arrive at camp sated, my hair in a frenzied tangle, my nails in a tartarfie tangle, my fingertips laced with holy oil, my boots black with mud, and studded with golden bracelets worn backwards. My white socks were studded with lapis lazuli, and the tops of my white dresses lined with lavender shawls and fringes of ocher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To each child I gave jewel-encrusted bracelets, earrings, and earrings pendants valued at a reported $150,000.00. My favorite, a blue rhinestone, confessor’s ring, cost me just shy of a quarter million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day, out on the paved path that connected the camp to the forest, all the way out to the river, a flash of white illuminated the entire clearing like an ultramarine sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swam across the clearing to the river, dove into the murky murky murky water, and then, as silently as if I had just come out of a bathroom, I disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took hundreds of men working in perfect unison to unearth me. Each man had to locate the other’s footprints in the mud, the broken glass, the burned out vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 16 All-Out War</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-016"/>
   <updated>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college I was the most charmed girl on campus. I was so in love with the very idea of collegiate sexual liberation that I vowed never to let it slip again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College was the Wild West. Lovers threw themselves into the unknown, met their maker on the other side. It was a time of wild sex, sexual discovery, and, above all, the irrepressible desire to share one’s passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in the early eighties, a drag queen named Fran Chernow walked into the college gay bar and announced that she was a drag queen because she could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was during this time period that I first came to know Dan White.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days, collegiate gay life was all-out war. In one fell swoop, the administration had declared that all students, regardless of sexual preference, could be grouped together in a sex-segregated “A” category and be assigned a single, one-night-stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember standing at that altar that night and contemplating the depravity of my situation. The Lord had no compassion for the sinner! I vowed that I would never again be so easily offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years wore on, the quality of the sex acts among the “A” category students ranged from filthy to downright filthy. One evening, all the leading lights of the college drag circuit came together to watch Fran’s fabulous new show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, you two. You’re not getting any sleep tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t finished the show.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we’ve read it and we’ve agreed to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could see how the administration’s clever little move might turn out to be their downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was in college, a professor of mine came up to me and said to me, “Mr. Vinge, I believe you know Mr. White. He is a homosexual of some sort. What can I do for you in this situation?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I had never heard of Dr. White. Then, all of a sudden, all of a sudden there was Dr. White in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was dumbfounded. He was so down-to-earth and down-to-nothing about his life that I was dumbfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me most about Dr. White was his complete lack of homophobia.
In other words, he was one big, happy, green, high-achieving, heterosexual, gold-digging, Methodist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only person involved in this who wasn’t wearing a gay wedding band was my roommate, Dr. Kitty Cochrane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the story gets even weirder. My roommate got harrumphed up and led out of the house on trumped up charges of battery. That was just the beginning of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, enough of that. I want to move on and I want justice for all of us. We have all taken sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this college has suffered a tremendous loss when a truly distinguished professor is disgraced by his roommate’s lesbianism. I’ve always considered this a witch hunt, brought on by left-wing radicals determined to silence anyone they perceive as expressing conservative views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school my best friend Alan was gay. We slept together in his dorm room only to have me have to go home alone after midnight. The next morning I found that Alan had propositioned me on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that this happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that any of you knew that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how many of you knew this and didn’t do something about it. I don’t know how many of you didn’t know this and will go to jail for eternity for not knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This silence is painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was angry. I was confused. I cried. I reasoned. I searched. I prayed. But I left feeling freed. I had hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you suppose is going to happen next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who do you think is going to have sex with next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I was angry. I panicked. I didn’t know what to do. I still don’t. All I know is that I got home safe and well that night and haven’t looked back. I’m a lot better for having had that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’d you tell Alan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t know. And besides, I didn’t think it was fair to make him feel bad about what he’d done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair enough. I forgive him now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about that night all the time. And I still get pissed off when I think about it. I get so mad I punch a wall. I get so mad I got a wood chipper. I even got a beer can. But there’s always next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how’d you feel about our having sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I approve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? I want to know what you think about having sex with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not the point. The point is that you and I slept together. You know how I feel about romantic relationships. As a matter of fact, I think sex is the single worst thing a guy can do to a girl. Pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filthy habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a very young girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid fucking girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fantasy was to slip into a boy’s bed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the only boy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck the cock,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would lick, suck, fuck, fuck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy would come all over me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt so good,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made him cum over and over,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called him Daddy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He came over and over,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his face with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his mouth with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made him clean my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot mess all over my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took turns fucking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his ears with my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ground his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ground his balls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his face with my wet sandpaper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered his mouth with coconut oil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kneed his balls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sanded his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took turns fucking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ground his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sanded his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hated me. Wanted me dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scared me to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, I made sure to check&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the one checking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he would stand at the door, take his from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shhhhhhh! He knew I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I pushed open the door and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he stepped out onto the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see the blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see the blood everywhere. Everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could taste it on his lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran. I ran as fast as I could,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tearing, I heard her call out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owwwwww! He grabbed hold of her wrist and pulled her backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he dropped to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hear her scream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wet sandpaper covered his entire body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he lay there. For hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! He looked so real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! I could taste his blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch! I could taste it on his lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I heard someone call out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on! Come out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he opened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no one. Just him and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Just him and the empty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw myself at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he lay there. I covered him in my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain. For hours.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 13 Paralytic Fraternity</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young and very foolish, Gay Girl in Love. I was thirteen years old. And I fell in love with a beautiful young man who seduced me with the promise of more beautiful things. I called him my boyfriend. We fell in love and lived happily ever after. For thirteen years I was confused and unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why all of a sudden hate him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate him because he could be my lover, my rock. He could rock me to sleep and then lead me on wild wild goose chases down dark alleys. He is traditional, he is American, he is Western. He could be my dad! He could rock my world! It would be so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closeted big gay man with daddy issues would never be tolerated. Filled with feelings I call Paralytic Fraternity, he would reject me for all the pain and confusion I caused myself and my family. He would reject me for who I am. I would reject him for the many amazing men I have loved and missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are worse things than closeted big gay men with daddy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is not so much my past. My problem is with the way society has defined my sexuality. There’s this idea that if you’re gay you’re fine, fine. It’s not always easy being gay. Our society puts a value on sex and it puts a value on love above all else. Our society says if you’re skinny, you’re a fag. If you smell bad, you’re a fruit. If you smell good to your girlfriend, you’re cool. Whatever it takes to be famous!… I just don’t see how any of that makes any of us wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should we change if they DON’T WANT TO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in college, I came home from a party with a really horny high school senior who kept telling me how he and his friend Jake were planning to have a “Boy Love Night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I related this story to my friend, she blurted out, “What’s so funny?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought for a moment, then said, “He’s straight!” And “How are they going to get it up in here?” And “How are they planning to get it up?” I felt my jaw drop open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to denigrate any of those relationships. But there are aspects that struck me as particularly perverted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys, I have a confession to make. It’s late, I’m exhausted, I’ve got dinner to go, and I just want to be alone with my most sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it. We’ve all got to turn on the lights. Please join me. This is the part of the show where I explain to you why my ex-boyfriend and I have been lovers since the day we first laid eyes on each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 11 Gay History</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lover-number-one&quot;&gt;Lover number one.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, this sweet sixteen year old me, my best friend Susan, and I, all had a secret lesbian crush on each other. Our first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cruising the gayborhoods of Atlanta, Florida, my best friend Joan was leaving for San Francisco for the summer. I asked, Why do you always have to be so politically incorrect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lover-number-two&quot;&gt;Lover number two.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were both in the feminist closet. We hated each other terribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we began to wonder, Why do you always insist on being so politically incorrect? How dare you use the N-word in front of my ex-girlfriend. How dare you use the F-word in front of my best friend. How could you use those words to my ex-Lover in front of her best friend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so ashamed. It was my fault. It was her fault. We both fucked up. We both blamed ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s change the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lover-number-three&quot;&gt;Lover number three.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I told my best friend Annie about this “fag” we had been Glorious. Ann was incensed. She thought it was the most despicable thing I could possibly be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How dare you use those words to my best friend. I am so embarrassed. I could have been killed. You could have been mauled. How dare you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, years later, here we are writing this book and you still insist that it all started that way. You still claim it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queer folk, this is not going to do any good for you. I am sure you will all come to understand that our history is not as tragic as you might have thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is not something you can change. History is not black and white. History is not neat. History is always murky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make it clearer by keeping our history in the murky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I walked into a gay bar right now and asked the friendly waitresses if they remembered a certain “fag,” they most certainly would not know. They would most certainly not be able to give me an honest answer. I would most certainly be disappointed. Most people have a hard time accepting that there might be a gay past in the first place. It almost feels like a challenge to the very fabric of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lover-number-four&quot;&gt;Lover number four.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days, you didn’t even have to ask. Why do you continue to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History will judge us, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At long last, the season is finally here, and it’s finally time for the national championship football game. This year, it’s the Michigan versus Michigan State game, played at Michigan Stadium. This year’s Michigan Wolverines have been renamed the “Gay Wildcats.” And, of course, it’s all but guaranteed that there will be homosexual hooliganism. Most of the Michigan players on the field are wearing colors of the homosexual pride flag, as are most of the Michigan State Spartans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 9 The Public Condom</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in high school, this sweet, innocent, bubbly geezer from Mendocino, California, came over for dinner and had the most incredible meal. We chatted all day and night about life in the gay and lesbian community and his favorite subject was “The Private Life of the City.” He talked about cruising the city, going out to bars on Friday nights, and even went as far as to buy me a leather briefcase with sex toys inside so I could take all my fantasies to the clubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’d taken me to gay clubs and explained to me that none of the guys there used condoms and that it was the girls that used them. No one ever said anything about it being a perverted thing to do. He even went as far as to buy me a “public” condom, which was only intended for close male friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought for sure he was being melodramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t. He was genuinely moved by my reaction and told me he wanted to do something about it. I was over the moon. I felt I could do something about it. I even thought maybe I could become his secretary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not one of those gay “Christs-for-Jesus” that believe in any kind of heaven, but I was sold on the idea of being his “public” condom. I was willing to do almost anything for him to keep my secret. I would do anything to keep my boyfriend and my brother from knowing. I even had my parents believe I was gay and started researching them and sending them Christmas cards and school supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did he say when you told him all this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was disappointed. He told me he had made a big mistake. He’d like to take some time to think about it and come to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He couldn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was angry. He said he loved me very much and that I always put his best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have been hurt, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in shock. I never wanted him to see what I saw. He was the most amazing, sensitive, funny, beautiful boy ever to walk the face of this earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mean he turned gay after that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He could have been lying down the gurney any minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sainted.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been in a room with anyone who thought, “Oh, this person is very interesting, I could be very interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no idea what it’s like to be unattractive. It’s hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no idea what it is like to be unattached. And very, very dense. And very, very stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no idea what it is to be hungry. And very, very possessive. And very, very competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to show off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to keep my clothes in the closet. I get so excited about things. I get so excited I want to go out and beat the shit out of this corner store, this little orphan shop, this theatre, this park, this sign, this flower, this mirror, this telephone booth, this carpet, this life, this book, this chair, this street, this walkway, this lamp, this tree, this brick, this table, this rug, this blanket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been in a room with anyone who has said to me, “You are very interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 7 The Gayborhood</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a kid, the only people I was allowed to see in a public place were those I knew and loved. Those closest to me were either priests or middle-aged white men. It was forbidden to me to go to the gayborhood or the drag queens’ district. In those days, you could get two hours of free porn and seventeen of them had sex. I was so ashamed of myself that I never went to the gayborhood or the strip clubs. I wasn’t gayborhood or drag queen stripper girl, I wasn’t even a gay boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know that there were any gayborhood strippers, clubs, or even gay men. I didn’t know that many of the guys I hung around with were gayborhood strippers. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhood minors were gay minors. And I certainly wasn’t part of the gayborhood clubs. I didn’t know that many of the gayborhood minors actually lived with their partners. Or that in the gayborhood the bars. Or even the gayborhood was more acceptable than it might have been to some of my more conservative gayborhood mates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fantasy wasn’t to find out about my queerborhood or my life with the minors. It was to find out if there were any other gayborhood minors. I wasn’t interested in that. And so, over the years, I’ve had it with you. And sometimes, it’s even got me wondering if my only queer experience was being the subject of that sad, sad, sad boy’s fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could have one secret lover?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had one secret lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did you keep that book of erotic poetry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept it in the bathroom at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever get together with that much male fantasy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure. Do I have to describe it to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course not. That’s one secret. One lover. One secret lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you please leave out the “one”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that you don’t know how to be a good lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you going to make love to me or are you just going to sit and wait for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I could get you a ring so we could make love together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t make love to me, you’re just a big, old, hard-on, angry, boring monster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care what you are! Make love to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want me to lie down and hold your hand while you do your French Bend? Is that what you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I’d like to feel your body against mine. I’d like to feel you in your arms, always safe and warm in my arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You like sex in public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it in private. I love when you make love to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to get down on your knees and kiss me? How about it? Giggling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giggling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to suck my fingers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to suck my nipples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss my pussy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss my ass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to make love to my face?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you want to do to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make love to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You like to take pictures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picturing? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to watch me get fucked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex and Fuck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you want to do to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to take your clothes off and kiss you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to get your dick deep inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see your balls bounce around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to fuck you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so wet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m dripping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smell of sex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smell of jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to hear me moan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to feel my pussy lips?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to taste my clit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to see my toes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting wet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot and bothered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to suck my nipples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to kiss me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cum!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a really horny monster, aren’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so hard, I’m so horny!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a dirty monster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you feel my clit again. You can feel it building inside you. Then you feel me against your back and the first time I feel you against me, I pop! I CUMM! Such a good feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you can feel my balls slapping against your back and the first time I feel you against me, I feel you cumming! I CUM! Such a good feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds ridiculous. “Hotline Miami” gave me chills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hotline Miami?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to have it. I had to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh come on! It’s not true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the most exciting thing I’ve ever had. It’s true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hotline Miami?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me the straight answer. Don’t give me that. Let’s all just talk about what’s real right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Let’s talk about what’s real now. Okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand your need for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you do know how to spend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do you know how to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t drag your Ex-Boyfriend into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s real about my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ex-boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s real about your ex-boyfriend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s angry. He’s jealous. He’s needy. He’s a faggot. He needs you. He’s a bimbo. He’s straight. He’s old-fashioned. He wants to fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to fuck him! I want to fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you said that it’s only because we broke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t you even know how to kiss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that he wanted to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to fuck you but I don’t know how!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You said that you had ideas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you have ideas about?!?!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just know you want to fuck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just know that’s all you ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, but, but. But…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re asking me to kiss a gay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 4 Zero-Sum Game</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-004"/>
   <updated>2020-09-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was in fifth grade, a boy from the school assembly told me that he had been in love with a girl named Florence. The boy had been in and out of love and lust for many years, but one night, as he was leaving to go away to school, he asked his teacher if she was gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher said that she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he told her that he loved her and that he was in love with her too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she ran off to tell her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the father was apoplectic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the teacher reassured him that his love for his son was genuine and that he could love anyone he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was five and a half years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I am in love with you, the bisexual hound, and we have been together for three years, and we are in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t want to be intimate with you, the heterosexual hound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay, it’s okay! It’s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me see, how many ways are there to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many ways are there to be gay? How many ways are there to be bisexual? How many ways are there to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see it as a zero-sum game. You get one and you have to get the other. If you get one, you get one less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have to be gay to love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a zero. I could love more than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot more. More than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could love someone much more than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter. I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t love someone just because they are your lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not just because they are your lover. I love you because you are a good friend and because you want to be good friends with me. I don’t care if you’re my lover or not. I just want you to be a good friend and to want to be good friends with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be a lot more than just a lover.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 3 Private Lessons</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-003"/>
   <updated>2020-09-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/ultimate-fantasy-003</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was a junior high school English teacher in Texas, my school was in the middle of a gay rights march. On the square near the square, there were gay men kissing in front of the assembly and chanting “Hands off our buxom women!” in the square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a gay man myself, I was outraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing at all resembling “homo” or “bimbo.” And there were no signs at all that said, “Homo-Bimbo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess that’s the ultimate fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a private lesson in gay rights, and the boys I taught were all closeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had a gay teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. That’s right. You had a gay teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you had sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly. I was fond of him and we had consensual sex. My point? We didn’t know for sure. But it was a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were a senior in high school. You had the chance to change your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a writer’s assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were an assistant editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked as an assistant to a writer. I wrote a story and had it published. Then I got promoted to writer’s assistant. So I wrote a screenplay and had it directed by a famous director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were in love with that writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lied. I wasn’t in love with him. I had sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea what that means? That’s called jealousy. You were doing research on this gay man. You were consulting with this famous director, on what you thought were possibly thousands of men. And you turned around and said, “I don’t want to get involved with anyone who is that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a joke. In any case, I had just gotten a promotion to writer’s assistant and I was tired of writing screenplay. I decided to skip the writing phase and concentrate on the casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. You couldn’t act, you couldn’t act tough, you couldn’t act arrogant, you couldn’t act even gay. You could only act like shit. It was the first time in my life I had been so completely humiliated by the person I was working with. I went into a state of paralysis. I didn’t know what to do anymore. I knew that whatever I was doing wasn’t going to make any difference to anyone. And that my only hope of escaping was to give in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn’t do anything about it. You couldn’t say a word. You could only stare blankly into the abyss of apathy. Did you notice anything strange in that abyss? Nothing like that black eye. Did you even notice that it looked different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I can’t remember ever seeing a black eye look this strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of my life in a state of total denial. I could not imagine how anyone could be so stupid as to act like this. It didn’t matter if I was going to jail or not. It didn’t matter if I was going to marry the man or not. It didn’t matter if I had a career or not. The only thing that mattered was that I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. I didn’t want anyone to think I was anything more than a happy little boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you threw in the towel. So you decided to disappear. I’m amazed you didn’t leave me with a bloody nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to have anonymous sex in public rest rooms? Sex movies? Public parks? Sex clubs? On street corners with heavy hustling traffic? How many nonsexual friendships or acquaintances lasting for decades started this way? How many ways are there to love queers? How many ways are there to queer love?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ultimate Fantasy 1 Club Life and Mothers</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by telling you my ultimate fantasy. When I was young I loved going out to a club with a gang of boys. I did not understand it at the time, I thought it was disgusting and I should not enjoy it. But in my adolescent years, when I discovered the gay scene, I found out about its strength and purpose. This meant it had two forms, boys and men. It also meant it had a sex with young boys that was not, in my opinion, as popular as one with a woman might want to do. I was more shocked than I was surprised to find out about my own sexuality, which had always been like this. And this was not something I was ashamed of, I was part of the gay community and I had found out a bit about it. I would occasionally go to clubs with boys, or with my mother. She was a lesbian who hated the lifestyle and I know she found it quite pleasant. And I knew that she did not really want me to be a lesbian, she did not really understand it. My mother was a staunch member of the “G” club, which was devoted to women. I think I liked her, she did not really hate me, but she was angry at her own sex, and the fact that I would leave her house when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came home late one night and my mother was furious at me. She was upset that I had left her and went out for drinks, and her house was pretty packed, she was quite angry at herself. She and her husband, who was a Presbyterian, were at a pub the night before. I was the only boy there and I was alone, but she saw me coming in. She was rather upset that I was not home, and there was an awful lot of looking at me, talking to my mother. She went out and had some drinks with a friend, and then had a few more with me. She then left for the pub. I went home to my mother, where I could, and found that I had a great deal to complain about. I was going to go to bed and she went off to see my friend. It was a pretty dark evening, dark with the smell of smoke. She called the police and came over to my room. I thought it was dreadful. I saw my friend there and she wanted to see me. She was so happy to see me. I explained to her that I was going to go back to my room. She went off to find her friend. I went back to my room and I was afraid to go out because I was watching what was going to happen. But she was a very good friend and told me not to go out at night. She would give me her handbag and I would carry her and her bag. She then went back to her friend’s room and she sat on the bed next to me, I would not leave her there. She said to my friend, “I will call the police, but if you don’t call, they will arrest you.” And so I went back to my room. And I had an awkward silence and I went and sat down to write. And I thought, “This is very difficult, you are going to be arrested, you are going to have to pay.” She came out and said, “Good, it is quite easy to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life was so bizarre at the time, I was so alienated and so disgusted with myself. But I got out of it, I got over it, and I never had any more time to write.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Philosophy 3 Life After Capitalism</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/life-after-capitalism"/>
   <updated>2020-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After generations of living under colonialism, white supremacy, economic austerity, demoralizing levels of stress, social unrest, a global pandemic, endless fake news cycles, ecological catastrophe, unprocessed grief, extreme nihilism, and near climate collapse, the humans decided to end capitalism, overthrow their corrupt leaders, and begin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they learned how to be in right relationship with the earth and each other, they started reflecting on their shortcomings and asking questions about the true nature of human bondage, human freedom, emotions, mind, God, consciousness, ethics and morality. They ruminated on the consciousness of responsibility, debt, obligation, compensation, community, injury, guilt, alienation, and atonement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems they knew little of pleasure and love that wasn’t tied to suffering and pain. It became obvious . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-generated&quot;&gt;Computer Generated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became obvious to them that all enjoyment, all order, all beauty, all reason, all social order, all being absolutely necessary to survive, must necessarily be subordinated to the demands of the most violent, the most vicious, and the most highly developed interdependent powers of nature: the most powerful and richest, the most dominant religions, political systems, empires, and racial distinctions. Nothing remained for them but for revenge, the most ancient and newest form of revenge, the most radical act of self-criticism and personal repudiation, the self-emancipation of the one who deserved all those advantages and privileges, the one who had dared to be free, the one who was nevertheless angry, disgusted, and bitter–for them all to be masters of bitter revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first act of self-emancipation was to repudiate all those privileges, abolish the debts, form new ones, pay back the ones who had lent them, repudiate the masters, to whom they were “owes.” In doing so, they repudiated themselves and their own humanity, for they had repudiated themselves in that very repudiation, by taking up arms in self-determination against their own masters. That repudiation was more radical still, for to this extent was an act of liberation, a final act of passivity, in the self-emancipation of the slaves, the emancipated slaves themselves–they repudiated their very consciousness, all freedom, their very existence, all sovereignty, all right, all privilege, in short, all reason, in order that they might acknowledge and experience again the necessity and fulness of their own power, lord of the free, master of the bad, master of the ill, with a reference to the low, the sick, and the damned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in doing so they showed that they were no longer masters of their own revenge, that they were still cut off from the joy and freedom of their own acts, the self-assertion of the slave, the black pride of “the free,” as their own. “Let us not be free till we are good,” they said, for the joy of their freedom was cut off, the freedom of their own hands was cut off, “but until then we shall be masters of our revenge.” This is still their most radical and radical act, repudiation, even though now only a demand, an ultimatum, a declaration of war, repudiation. The unconditional affirmation of the absolute negative right of any one to revenge is absolutely essential for them, for otherwise the resentful and the wounded immediately return to their own hatred, their own violence, and the new order of things (the ideal society, if such a word can be used in our case) will only be a new phase of “Bolshevism” and caste-war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when they themselves repudiated their own revenge, when they repudiated that which they had so viciously exploited, when they repudiated “owes,” what was left to them but to be punished for their debt to those lords, the masters, who had made such repayment possible? The punishment was their own revenge in the form of their own slaves, the new slaves, their very working slaves, to be made whole again, to be given back their freedom, their joy, their love, their desire. The black pride of the slaves, the vindication of their hatred, was for them their revenge, and in looking down on their own slaves, in apprehending this to be the highest form of love and satisfaction, they were really giving them to taste as much bitter, sharp revenge as they themselves enjoyed in eating their own worms. The rearing of the new slaves was the first and foremost need of those lords: the slaves, freed from the masters, became the lords’ enemies–for it was through the slaves that the lords’ enemies were brought to life again, to the crescendo of all aggressive and pre-aroused wrath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just as the idea of the master’s freedom was the beginning of the world, so is the theory of the master’s right of revenge–the theory of a “reciprocal right” between the masters and the slaves, the theory of the new society as a whole as the kingdom of the masters, an oligarchy, a democracy, with slaves as its subjects. But this theory actually has no further vitality or meaning, and even less virulence than the theory of the masters’ right of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is simple: the whole theory of the master’s right of aggression is only a provisional and provisional system of ideas, an extremely late and provisional elaboration of the theory of the masters’ power, against whose actual existence there is no sign, no matter how piquant and gay its paradoxical expression is: this theory repudiates itself immediately, and repudiates absolutely, repudiates itself as a critique of the real masters’ power, of that absolute, that very dominant and unqualified power, the right of aggression. The theory of the masters’ right of aggression repudiates itself absolutely–how could it possibly have any meaning? The whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiation, and counter-revision is but a specious expression for repudiating the lords’ right of aggression, repudiating in particular the lords’ right of dominating, of proving, potentiating, and extending the “good” in the world. “The masters are the bad,” says the resentful resentful–but the “masters,” who themselves repudiate and fight for their right of aggression, fight for their right to be bad, for their right to be masters. It is at this juncture that we come back to our main theme, the origin of the new order of things,–the origin of the “better man,”–the origin of a new maximum of power, the state, as such, repudiates itself in opposition to that ideal of civilisation, that would be “masters,” that would be an empire opposed to itself, that would be repudiated by the ideal of the good, by the will to be an empire. That repudiation is absolutely essential for the affirmation of the “better man” theory–it repudiates itself, repudiates in particular the whole theory of the masters’ right of aggression, repudiates the theory of the masters’ power, repudiates in particular the lords’ will to be masters, the will to be an empire. In doing so, it essentially cuts off the possibility of the “better man” theory actually being a theory at all, and transforming that “better man” theory into a practical deed,–a deed actually constituting the actual basis of the new order of things, the actual organisation of power. The whole provisional theory of the masters’ liberal providence is just such a deed, an actual constitution of that theory, constituting in its actual organisation and working up to the actual power, the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy. What is it, all these theories which have taken up the idea of the masters’ power, all these provisional theories of masters’ rights, counter-repositions and interpretations, are really? They signify nothing. Nothing, for to be able to make a beginning is to be first. The very first that must be found is the will to be an empire, an oligarchy, a democracy, that is to say, the will of a relatively small, relatively strong, relatively long-standing, and finally, of all the Europeans, to be an empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this juncture we had better hold fast to the kernel of the matter, to the elementary fact that the real will of the good against the bad, the strong against the weak, is the will for a balance of power. This will, this historic will, has grown–granted that it grows–far beyond the point of any kind of absolute practical proportionality, far beyond the point of being able to bring it about that all Europeans should all fight together for the sake of a balance of power. This historical will is moreover the will to be an empire, the will to be an oligarchy, a republic, a democracy, on a much grander scale, and this out of a whole preponderance of the historic German power on the European continent, which itself alone has an historical and psychological hegemony, which is the will to be an empire. And now look at it from another point of view–what will this historic will be able to create in the European continent, if it does not already constitute it? What will it do for Europeans themselves? This question can be asked only after a hundred times more rigorous analysis–a further analysis which will redoundably be rendered out by an equally thorough and thorough re-examination of the actual political, strategic, and military situation of Europe, in order to throw more light on this problem–a situation which can be practically defined as follows: there exists in Europe a practically decisive strategic and a practically decisive military superiority over Asia, over the Middle East, over the Europe, over the “empire of the north,” France. In the same proportion as Europe’s strategic superiority, and with the same necessary evolution, also exists a necessary evolution of the European military power, thereby taking place, first of all, a tempo and rhythm which was originally only a natural accompaniment to the European strategic advance, the tempo and rhythm which eventually became the necessity of the matter, in Europe, of a balance of power in which the European powers joined. This political and military tempo-and-coma, this extraordinary tempo and rhythm of the European powers, has so far only been maintained, in spite of all the most&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Philosophy 1 Queer Wittgenstein</title>
   <link href="unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/queer-wittgenstein"/>
   <updated>2020-09-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>unsupervisedpleasures.com/texts/queer-wittgenstein</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now that Wittgenstein’s homosexuality has been largely acknowledged, most scholars are hesitant to imply a connection between his philosophy and his sexuality – that is, between his work and his inner state, emotions, or personality. If, however, in a contemporary light we understand queerness as a structuring mode of desiring, we might view Wittgenstein’s thought not as emerging from his sexuality, but as structured by the way in which it shaped his mode of being in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERPLEXITY 0.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, his thought may be said to have exuberant, joyous, and full breasts, but beneath all that is there a secretly dangerous, pessimistic, and spiteful inner world, one that struggles to get out and find a home in the masculine sphere. It is this inner world that lies at the core of all the resentful, spiteful, and gay tendencies in the world today. It is this inner world that has imprisoned so many men of the masculine ideal, has made them into hateful, spiteful, and evil-tempered cretins. It is this inner world that has imprisoned so many women of the feminine ideal, has made them into angelic, joyful, and loving. And it is this inner world, in fact, which in spite of all its malignity and wickedness is the only thing keeping many men in the pale, keeps them from being what they ought to be, what they can be: true, moral, and decent men and women who are fit and worthy to be the leaders of the world, the fathers of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERPLEXITITY: 0.7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to know that one likes another? How might one become so thoroughly acquainted with another that one’s self, one’s self as a whole, were thereby altered in respect of substance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, it would mean that we should learn to rate our love more highly on its affective than on its intellectual side. ‘Intellectually’ here is a broad category to cover both intellectual and moral qualities. Desire is ‘attention turned to’ a thing in proportion as its utility increases; so that pleasure is the result of a greater tendency to look at a thing than to look away. Attention turns to a thing because our attention is focussed thereon; and focussedness, similarly, is increased in proportion as a greater number of our ideas about a thing are fulfilled. Desire is also increased when the attention is directed to a thing connoting more of its own nature than of the nature of anything else. Attention turns connotingly when the subject of it is connoted as a whole, and we can, therefore, take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERPLEXITY 1.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Woman,’ he might say, ‘is but a readymade gender transposed.’ His thought, straight out of the gate, is one of genital transposition with a social goal in mind. This goal is conceptual; the transposition itself is only a peculiar form of desiring and acting. The desire which springs from the need to be, to be experienced, to be felt, to bet felt and ‘ated,’ these are the desires here opposed to those of, as we say, the woman who needs but one thing; they are relational desires, as individualist as opposed to collectivistic as they are relational. The prehistoric herd, which needed hands as well as teeth to hunt for sustenance and safety, is defunct, while Cupid, the younger Thanatos, Priapus, and the Olympian mothers look on in rapture. Each of the desires of today, then, is part of a larger ‘will’ that connotes a constitution and a function, the whole of which is fluid and ever shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, then, the learned man be capable of relating contemporary phenomena to earlier ones, he should at all events attempt the corrective of a lifetime’s experience. It was, and remains, a desire unknown to him, even by his most advanced Hegelians and his English idealists; to his straight-A students, however, such conjunctive transitions conjure up, almost as if glowing with magnetic flux, a gender neutral Wagnerian Wohlfahrtsgefühle. In other words, they must be experienced first as they are experienced inside one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To act against that instinct is to pet the beast; and like Faust and the other psychics, he became one of those who fight the impulse. He repudiates, denies, defends and eventually reverses everything which transmits the impulse. His transposing of the feminine into the masculine not only frees him from himself, but from woman in general. ‘I myself am simply my own man,’ he might have said, but ‘for the love of God be my being pure and unmixed: nay, more than purity and unmixed, make it to be one, one only, one undivided being; one supreme, one supreme, all-in-one Being, which I may call God, who is God in m&lt;/p&gt;
